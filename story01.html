What happens when we teach a computer how to learn? Technologist Jeremy Howard shares some surprising new developments in the fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give computers the ability to learn Chinese, or to recognize objects in photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis. (One deep learning tool, after watching hours of YouTube, taught itself the concept of “cats.”) Get caught up on a field that will change the way the computers around you behave … sooner than you probably think. 	<br><br>
 The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn  	<br><br>
  Dec 2014 	<br><br>

It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new, you would have to program it. Now, programming, for those of you here that haven't done it yourself, requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now, if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself, then this is going to be a great challenge. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:35	<br><br>
	
So this was the challenge faced by this man, Arthur Samuel. In 1956, he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program, lay out in excruciating detail, how to be better than you at checkers? So he came up with an idea: he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked, and in fact, by 1962, this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:06	<br><br>
	
So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning, and I have a great debt to him, because I am a machine learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle, a community of over 200,000 machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems, and it's been successful hundreds of times. So from this vantage point, I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past, can do today, and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm, and this algorithm is based on machine learning. Since that time, there have been many commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy, movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes, it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it, and this is because it's using the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at "Jeopardy," answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one. ["The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in 2003 (along with a lot of other stuff)"] This is also why we are now able to see the first self-driving cars. If you want to be able to tell the difference between, say, a tree and a pedestrian, well, that's pretty important. We don't know how to write those programs by hand, but with machine learning, this is now possible. And in fact, this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:51	<br><br>
	
So we now know that computers can learn, and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves, or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. Now, what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community, but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences, and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this? They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning. So important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left-hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works, and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more computation time you give it, the better it gets. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:59	<br><br>
	
The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers can listen and understand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:11	<br><br>
	
(Video) Richard Rashid: Now, the last step that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is, we've been able to take a large amount of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text-to-speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language, and then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text-to-speech system so that it would sound like me. Again, the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. (In Chinese) (Applause) There's much work to be done in this area. (In Chinese) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:12	<br><br>
	
Jeremy Howard: Well, that was at a machine learning conference in China. It's not often, actually, at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause, although of course sometimes at TEDx conferences, feel free. Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning. (Applause) Thank you. The transcription in English was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text in the top right, deep learning, and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:37	<br><br>
	
So deep learning is this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything, and I discovered that a year earlier, it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm, the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people, about twice as good as people. So by 2011, we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. Since that time, a lot has happened. In 2012, Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on 16,000 computers for a month, and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way that humans learn. Humans don't learn by being told what they see, but by learning for themselves what these things are. Also in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton, who we saw earlier, won the very popular ImageNet competition, looking to try to figure out from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of 2014, we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people, again. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:52	<br><br>
	
So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this, and it is now being used in industry. For example, Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours, and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long it would have taken before: dozens of people, many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of the Chinese Google, I guess, and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system, and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually have similar backgrounds, similar directions of the faces, even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:57	<br><br>
	
So what does it mean now that computers can see? Well, it's not just that computers can see. In fact, deep learning has done more than that. Complex, nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here, this Stanford-based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things. Also, deep learning has been used to read Chinese, again at about native Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people, none of whom speak or understand any Chinese. As I say, using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this, even compared to native human understanding. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:47	<br><br>
	
This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together. These are pictures which have no text attached, and as I'm typing in here sentences, in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing. So you can see, it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen something like this on Google, where you can type in things and it will show you pictures, but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually understanding the images. This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
So we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read, and, of course, we've shown that they can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before, it's seen black before, it's seen a guitar before, but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human performance here, but we're close. In tests, humans prefer the computer-generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old, so probably within the next year, the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:27	<br><br>
	
So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities. For example, in medicine, a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly, in Stanford, a group there announced that, looking at tissues under magnification, they've developed a machine learning-based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases, not only were the predictions more accurate, but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case, they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand. In this pathology case, the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases, they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts, but as of last year, we're now beyond that too. This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately, or about as accurately, as human pathologists, but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field. Similarly, here, this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can, but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:07	<br><br>
	
So myself, as somebody with no previous background in medicine, I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company, which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it, but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully, the feedback has been fantastic, not just from the media but from the medical community, who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible, leaving doctors to do what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about 15 minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now, but I've compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test, I'm going to show you a diagnostic test of car images, because that's something we can all understand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:05	<br><br>
	
So here we're starting with about 1.5 million car images, and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled, so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm, it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together. So the human, as you can see here, is telling the computer about areas of interest which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now, these deep learning systems actually are in 16,000-dimensional space, so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space, trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully, the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting. So here, the computer has successfully found areas, for example, angles. So as we go through this process, we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis, for example, or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm. In this case, it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful, manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs, then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:32	<br><br>
	
So we do that for a while, we skip over a little bit, and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things, and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see, it's now started to fade some of these pictures out, showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept of similar images, and using similar images, you can now see, the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point, the human can tell the computer, okay, yes, you've done a good job of that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:04	<br><br>
	
Sometimes, of course, even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups. In this case, even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while, we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give the computer some hints, and we say, okay, try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint -- ah, okay, it's been successful. It's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:37	<br><br>
	
So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer, but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes 15 minutes for one person acting alone. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:01	<br><br>
	
So this process takes about four or five iterations. You can see we now have 62 percent of our 1.5 million images classified correctly. And at this point, we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections, check through them to make sure that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes, we can let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process for each of the different groups, we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images. And at this point, it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly, and trying to understand why. And using that approach, by 15 minutes we get to 97 percent classification rates. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:42	<br><br>
	
So this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem, which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x shortage of physicians in the developing world, and it would take about 300 years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:07	<br><br>
	
So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment. What are services? These are services. These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So 80 percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do. What does that mean? Well, it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example, there will be more jobs for data scientists. Well, not really. It doesn't take data scientists very long to build these things. For example, these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think, oh, it's all happened before, we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs, what are these new jobs going to be? It's very hard for us to estimate this, because human performance grows at this gradual rate, but we now have a system, deep learning, that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently, we see the things around us and we say, "Oh, computers are still pretty dumb." Right? But in five years' time, computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:21	<br><br>
	
We have seen this once before, of course. In the Industrial Revolution, we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines. The thing is, though, that after a while, things flattened out. There was social disruption, but once engines were used to generate power in all the situations, things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution, because the Machine Learning Revolution, it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities, the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities, so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before, so your previous understanding of what's possible is different. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:01	<br><br>
	
This is already impacting us. In the last 25 years, as capital productivity has increased, labor productivity has been flat, in fact even a little bit down. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:12	<br><br>
	
So I want us to start having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people about this situation, people can be quite dismissive. Well, computers can't really think, they don't emote, they don't understand poetry, we don't really understand how they work. So what? Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do, so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Social maps that reveal a city's intersections and separations</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Dave Troy	<br><br>
Dec-14	<br><br>
Every city has its neighborhoods, cliques and clubs, the hidden lines that join and divide people in the same town. What can we learn about cities by looking at what people share online? Starting with his own home town of Baltimore, Dave Troy has been visualizing what the tweets of city dwellers reveal about who lives there, who they talk to ― and who they don’t. Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
When we think about mapping cities, we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings, and the settlement narrative that led to their creation, or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer, but there's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made. Today, I want to show you a new kind of map. This is not a geographic map. This is a map of the relationships between people in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person, each line represents a relationship between those people, and each color represents a community within the network. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
Now, I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are, and TEDx also is down on the far right. (Laughter) Now, on the other side of the network, you tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are, but just to give some sense, the green part of the network we call Smalltimore, for those of us that inhabit it, because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. We see the same people over and over again, but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city. On the other end of the network, you have folks who are interested in things like hip-hop music and they even identify with living in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area over, say, the Baltimore city designation proper. But in the middle, you see that there's something that connects the two communities together, and that's sports. We have the Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens football team, Michael Phelps, the Olympian. Under Armour, you may have heard of, is a Baltimore company, and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:49	<br><br>
	
Let's take a look at San Francisco. You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco. On the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities, but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network, and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees, next to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks, at the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum. So you can see, though, that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real, and you can actually see that documented here. You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community. And so it leads to things like this. ["Evict Twitter"] Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago, and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco, and I think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:52	<br><br>
	
Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro. I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio, and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything's really kind of mixed up. It's a very heterogenous city in a way that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists. TEDxRio is down in the lower right, right next to bloggers and writers. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music. Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here. Other boy bands, country singers, gospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy, and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes. How cool is that? And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here. So you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music, but it's represented in a very different way, and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio as being a very multicultural, musically diverse city. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:49	<br><br>
	
So we have all this data. It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now, maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before. So what can we do with it? Well, I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. It's something that we choose to do, and we could choose not to do it, and if you kind of think about it, what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria, and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart. Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:25	<br><br>
	
The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity. We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here -- only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity. So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems, we need to start to think about diversity in a new way. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
And lastly, we have the ability to create interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way, and I believe that if we have that capability, we may even bear some responsibility to do so. 	<br><br>

So what is a city? I think some might say that it is a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings, but I believe that a city is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there, and I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">The small and surprisingly dangerous detail the police track about you</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
A very unsexy-sounding piece of technology could mean that the police know where you go, with whom, and when: the automatic license plate reader. These cameras are innocuously placed all across small-town America to catch known criminals, but as lawyer and TED Fellow Catherine Crump shows, the data they collect in aggregate could have disastrous consequences for everyone the world over. 	<br><br>

The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the police shooting of Michael Brown, underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment, designed for the battlefield, are making their way to small-town police departments across the United States. Although much tougher to observe, this same thing is happening with surveillance equipment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:37	<br><br>
	
NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:50	<br><br>
	
Location information can be very sensitive. If you drive your car around the United States, it can reveal if you go to a therapist, attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, if you go to church or if you don't go to church. And when that information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else, the government can gain a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:14	<br><br>
	
This information used to be private. Thanks to modern technology, the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:30	<br><br>
	
One of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader. If you haven't seen one, it's probably because you didn't know what to look for -- they're everywhere. Mounted on roads or on police cars, Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
But more than that, increasingly, local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing, but of every plate that passes them by, resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone. Did you know this was happening? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:20	<br><br>
	
When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him, this is what they got: in addition to the date, time and location, the police department had photographs that captured where he was going and often who he was with. The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway. The government has hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life. And if you drive a car in the United States, I would bet money that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
Mike hasn't done anything wrong. Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information? The reason it's happening is because, as the cost of storing this data has plummeted, the police departments simply hang on to it, just in case it could be useful someday. The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police departments are doing it. At the same time, the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data, and pooling them together into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits, showing where Americans have traveled. This document from the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this, is one of several that reveal the existence of this database. Meanwhile, in New York City, the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:59	<br><br>
	
The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States. In the U.K., the police department put 80-year-old John Kat on a plate reader watch list after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:19	<br><br>
	
License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today. Through a technique known as a cell tower dump, law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular time, a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. Also, using a device known as a StingRay, law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there. And if they don't know which house to target, they've been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment, so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech surveillance gear. Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:12	<br><br>
	
The question is, what should we do about this? I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat. History has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data, tracking the movements of innocent people, it gets abused, maybe for blackmail, maybe for political advantage, or maybe for simple voyeurism. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:31	<br><br>
	
Fortunately, there are steps we can take. Local police departments can be governed by the city councils, which can pass laws requiring the police to dispose of the data about innocent people while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward. Thank you. (Applause). 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">What veterinarians know that physicians don't </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species? A physician. In a fascinating talk, Barbara Natterson-Horowitz shares how a species-spanning approach to health can improve medical care of the human animal ― particularly when it comes to mental health. 	<br><br>

Ten years ago, I got a phone call that changed my life. At the time, I was cardiologist at UCLA, specializing in cardiac imaging techniques. The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo. An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke. They asked if I'd come to the zoo and image the animal's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:48	<br><br>
	
Now, to be clear, North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified, board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients. But occasionally, they do reach into the human medical community, particularly for some speciality consultation, and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help. I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla didn't have a torn aorta, evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur, make sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed, and in this picture, I'm listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesaving, collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained 700 cc's of fluid from the sac in which this lion's heart was contained. And this procedure, which I have done on many human patients, was identical, with the exception of that paw and that tail. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:13	<br><br>
	
Now most of the time, I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients, but some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients. And occasionally, on the very same day, I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo. And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me. Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients: congestive heart failure, brain tumors, leukemia, diabetes, arthritis, ALS, breast cancer, even psychiatric syndromes like depression, anxiety, compulsions, eating disorders and self-injury. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:31	<br><br>
	
Now, I've got a confession to make. Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad -- I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory -- learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans, it came as a much needed wake-up call for me. So I started wondering, with all of these overlaps, how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian, or consult the veterinary literature, for insights into one of my human patients? Why had I never, nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked, ever attended a veterinary conference? For that matter, why was any of this a surprise? I mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans. Every medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves or we've given to our families has first been tested on an animal. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:55	<br><br>
	
But there's something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own. Now, maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban. You know, we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant. Well, today's human hospitals, increasingly, are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology. And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:00	<br><br>
	
But I think there's an even deeper reason. Physicians and scientists, we accept intellectually that our species, Homo sapiens, is merely one species, no more unique or special than any other. But in our hearts, we don't completely believe that. I feel it myself when I'm listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook. I feel that tug of human exceptionalism, even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species, apart. Well, I'm trying these days. When I see a human patient now, I always ask, what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know? And, might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:18	<br><br>
	
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to. Fear-induced heart failure. Around the year 2000, human cardiologists "discovered" emotionally induced heart failure. It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life's savings with a roll of the dice, in a bride who'd been left at the alter. But it turns out, this "new" human diagnosis was neither new, nor was it uniquely human. Veterinarians had been diagnosing, treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos, from to deer to rabbits, since the 1970s. How many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:34	<br><br>
	
Self-injury. Some human patients harm themselves. Some pluck out patches of hair, others actually cut themselves. Some animal patients also harm themselves. There are birds that pluck out feathers. There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed. But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals. Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. Sometimes, soon after giving birth, some women become depressed, and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic. They may neglect their newborn, and in some extreme cases, even harm the child. Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally, a mare, soon after giving birth, will neglect the foal, refusing to nurse, and in some instances, kick the foal, even to death. But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone, and this leads to renewed interest, on the part of the mare, in her foal. Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of ob/gyn's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:46	<br><br>
	
Well, despite all of this promise, unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large. To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going to have to air some dirty laundry. Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. I'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists, but maybe especially animal doctors. Of course, most physicians don't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school, and that when we go to medical school, we learn everything there is to know about one species, Homo sapiens, but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds. So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession's condescension and ignorance. But here's one from the vets: What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species? A physician. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:10	<br><br>
	
Closing the gap has become a passion for me, and I'm doing this through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA, where we're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents. And through Zoobiquity conferences, where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients. At Zoobiquity conferences, participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher; how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:33	<br><br>
	
In the United States and now internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues, as peers, as doctors. After all, we humans are animals, too, and it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species-spanning approach to health. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:18	<br><br>
	
Because it turns out, some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human. And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live, grow, get sick and heal. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:50	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">The workforce crisis of 2030 ― and how to start solving it now</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
It sounds counterintuitive, but by 2030, many of the world's largest economies will have more jobs than adult citizens to do those jobs. In this data-filled ― and quite charming ― talk, human resources expert Rainer Strack suggests that countries ought to look across borders for mobile and willing job seekers. But to do that, they need to start by changing the culture in their businesses. 	<br><br>
Rainer Strack	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
2014 is a very special year for me: 20 years as a consultant, 20 years of marriage, and I'm turning 50 in one month. That means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:27	<br><br>
	
It was a gray November day, and I was overdue. The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day. As a matter of fact, 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany: more than 1.3 million. Last year, we just hit over 600,000, so half of my number. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
What you can see here is the German age pyramid, and there, the small black point at the top, that's me. (Laughter) (Applause) In red, you can see the potential working-age population, so people over 15 and under 65, and I'm actually only interested in this red area. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
Now, let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years. As you can see, the peak is moving to the right, and I, with many other baby boomers, will retire in 2030. By the way, I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area. The red area, so the potential working-age population in 2030, is already set in stone today, except for much higher migration rates. And if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014, it is much, much smaller. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:00	<br><br>
	
So before I show you the rest of the world, what does this mean for Germany? So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply, so people who provide labor, will go down in Germany, and will go down significantly. Now, what about labor demand? That's where it gets tricky. As you might know, the consultant's favorite answer to any question is, "It depends." So I would say it depends. We didn't want to forecast the future. Highly speculative. We did something else. We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last 20 years, and calculated the following scenario: if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth, we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth. And this is the green line: labor demand. So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly. Eight million people are missing, which is more than 20 percent of our current workforce, so big numbers, really big numbers. And we calculated several scenarios, and the picture always looked like this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:15	<br><br>
	
Now, to close the gap, Germany has to significantly increase migration, get many more women in the workforce, increase retirement age ― by the way, we just lowered it this year ― and all these measures at once. If Germany fails here, Germany will stagnate. We won't grow anymore. Why? Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth. And companies will look for talents somewhere else. But where? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
Now, we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest 15 economies in the world, representing more than 70 percent of world GDP, and the overall picture looks like this by 2020. Blue indicates a labor surplus, red indicates a labor shortfall, and gray are those countries which are borderline. So by 2020, we still see a labor surplus in some countries, like Italy, France, the U.S., but this picture will change dramatically by 2030. By 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies, including three out of the four BRIC countries. China, with its former one-child policy, will be hit, as well as Brazil and Russia. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:41	<br><br>
	
Now, to tell the truth, in reality, the situation will be even more challenging. What you can see here are average numbers. We de-averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels, and what we found were even higher shortfalls for high-skilled people and a partial surplus for low-skilled workers. So on top of an overall labor shortage, we will face a big skill mismatch in the future, and this means huge challenges in terms of education, qualification, upskilling for governments and companies. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:23	<br><br>
	
Now, the next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology. Will technology change this picture and boost productivity? Now, the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology. A long answer would go like this. Let's take Germany again. The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity. In the '90s, I worked in our Boston office for almost two years, and when I left, an old senior partner told me, literally, "Send me more of these Germans, they work like machines." (Laughter) That was 1998. Sixteen years later, you'd probably say the opposite. "Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans." (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:29	<br><br>
	
Technology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs. Not only in the production industry, but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots, artificial intelligence, big data, or automation. So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs, but when, how fast, and to what extent? Or in other words, will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis? Yes and no. This is a more sophisticated version of "it depends." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
Let's take the automotive industry as an example, because there, more than 40 percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place. In 1980, less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts. Today, this number is more than 30 percent and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030. And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs, like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system. In 1980, no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist. As a matter of fact, the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades, in spite of robots and automation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:12	<br><br>
	
So what does this mean? Yes, technology will replace a lot of jobs, but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon, and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch. And this kind of de-averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:36	<br><br>
	
So people, high-skilled people, talents, will be the big thing in the next decade. If they are the scarce resource, we have to understand them much better. Are they actually willing to work abroad? What are their job preferences? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:55	<br><br>
	
To find out, this year we conducted a global survey among more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries. Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap, at least in the short term, so we asked about mobility. More than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers are willing to work abroad. For me, a surprisingly high number. If you look at the employees aged 21 to 30, this number is even higher. If you split this number up by country, yes, the world is mobile, but only partly. The least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the U.S. Now where would these people like to move? Number seven is Australia, where 28 percent could imagine moving. Then France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, U.K., and the top choice worldwide is the U.S. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:01	<br><br>
	
Now, what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people? So, what are they looking for? Out of a list of 26 topics, salary is only number eight. The top four topics are all around culture. Number four, having a great relationship with the boss; three, enjoying a great work-life balance; two, having a great relationship with colleagues; and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work. So, do I get a thank you? Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment, but every day. And now, our global workforce crisis becomes very personal. People are looking for recognition. Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:02	<br><br>
	
Now, let me connect the dots. We will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch, plus a big cultural challenge. And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast. Right now, we are just at the turning point. So what can we, what can governments, what can companies do? Every company, but also every country, needs a people strategy, and to act on it immediately, and such a people strategy consists of four parts. Number one, a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills. Workforce planning will become more important than financial planning. Two, a plan for how to attract great people: generation Y, women, but also retirees. Three, a plan for how to educate and upskill them. There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us. And four, for how to retain the best people, or in other words, how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:22	<br><br>
	
However, one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes. Employees are resources, are assets, not costs, not head counts, not machines, not even the Germans. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

The greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon rainforest is not the jaguar or the harpy eagle, says Mark Plotkin, "It's the isolated and uncontacted tribes." In an energetic and sobering talk, the ethnobotanist brings us into the world of the forest's indigenous tribes and the incredible medicinal plants that their shamans use to heal. He outlines the challenges and perils that are endangering them ― and their wisdom ― and urges us to protect this irreplaceable repository of knowledge. 	<br><br>

Now, I'm an ethnobotanist. That's a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants. I've been doing this for a long time, and I want to tell you, these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will. But also, these cultures, these indigenous cultures, are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves. And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar, it's not the harpy eagle, it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. 	<br><br>

Now four years ago, I injured my foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat, she gave me cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots. It didn't work. Several months later, I was in the northeast Amazon, walked into a village, and the shaman said, "You're limping." And I'll never forget this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give me your machete." (Laughter) He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back, I went to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment, and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by? (Applause) Now, make no mistake ― Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised, but there's plenty of holes in it. Where's the cure for breast cancer? Where's the cure for schizophrenia? Where's the cure for acid reflux? Where's the cure for insomnia? The fact is that these people can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes cure things we cannot. Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis, a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world. Western treatment are injections of antimony. They're painful, they're expensive, and they're probably not good for your heart; it's a heavy metal. This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:36	<br><br>
	
This is the magic frog. My colleague, the late great Loren McIntyre, discoverer of the source lake of the Amazon, Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes, was lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago. He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matses. They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did. There, they took out palm leaf baskets. There, they took out these green monkey frogs ― these are big suckers, they're like this ― and they began licking them. It turns out, they're highly hallucinogenic. McIntyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of High Times magazine. You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures. This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl, or give it a lick, and he did, and he wrote, "My blood pressure went through the roof, I lost full control of my bodily functions, I passed out in a heap, I woke up in a hammock six hours later, felt like God for two days." (Laughter) An Italian chemist read this and said, "I'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog. What's this about the change in blood pressure?" Now, this is an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog, and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus. How ironic if these isolated Indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon, in the middle of a yage ceremony. I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture. This fellow looked at the medicine man, and he said, "You didn't go to medical school, did you?" The shaman said, "No, I did not." He said, "Well, then what can you know about healing?" The shaman looked at him and he said, "You know what? If you have an infection, go to a doctor. But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit. Western medicine can't touch those. I cure them." (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines. This is a viper from Brazil, the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de Sao Paulo here. It was later developed into ACE inhibitors. This is a frontline treatment for hypertension. Hypertension causes over 10 percent of all deaths on the planet every day. This is a $4 billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake, and the Brazilians did not get a nickel. This is not an acceptable way of doing business. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
5:22	<br><br>
	
The rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on Earth. There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love: "The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask." But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing. Here in Brazil, in the Amazon, around the world. I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here. The top half of the picture, you see where the Indians live. The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve. Top half Indians, bottom half white guys. Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows. Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs, bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change. In fact, the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:21	<br><br>
	
But in talking about destruction, it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all. It's a place of beauty and wonder. The biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest, tips the scale at 90 pounds. The goliath bird-eating spider is the world's largest spider. It's found in the Amazon as well. The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet. And the black cayman ― these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton. They're known to be man-eaters. The anaconda, the largest snake, the capybara, the largest rodent. A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at 201 pounds. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
Let's visit where these creatures live, the northeast Amazon, home to the Akuriyo tribe. Uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination. These are the people who know nature best. These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. By our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive. "They don't know how to make fire, or they didn't when they were first contacted." But they know the forest far better than we do. The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey, and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm. Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay. When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans, Pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon in a small band, looking for game, looking for medicinal plants, looking for a wife, in other small nomadic bands. But it's people like these that know things that we don't, and they have lots of lessons to teach us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:17	<br><br>
	
However, if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon, there are no indigenous peoples. This is what you find: rock carvings which indigenous peoples, uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe. These cultures that once danced, made love, sang to the gods, worshipped the forest, all that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:42	<br><br>
	
Let's move to the western Amazon, which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples. Each of these dots represents a small, uncontacted tribe, and the big reveal today is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:00	<br><br>
	
Why are these people isolated? They know we exist, they know there's an outside world. This is a form of resistance. They have chosen to remain isolated, and I think it is their human right to remain so. Why are these the tribes that hide from man? Here's why. Obviously, some of this was set off in 1492. But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade. The demand for natural rubber, which came from the Amazon, set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush. Rubber for bicycle tires, rubber for automobile tires, rubber for zeppelins. It was a mad race to get that rubber, and the man on the left, Julio Arana, is one of the true thugs of the story. His people, his company, and other companies like them killed, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:56	<br><br>
	
Even today, when people come out of the forest, the story seldom has a happy ending. These are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '80s. Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead. And remember, these are preliterate societies. The elders are the libraries. Every time a shaman dies, it's as if a library has burned down. They have been forced off their lands. The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands, and the Nukaks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia. From the Nukak lands, I want to take you to the southwest, to the most spectacular landscape in the world: Chiribiquete National Park. It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues, it has now expanded. It's bigger than the state of Maryland. It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity. It was first explored botanically in 1943 by my mentor, Richard Schultes, seen here atop the Bell Mountain, the sacred mountains of the Karijonas. And let me show you what it looks like today. Flying over Chiribiquete, realize that these lost world mountains are still lost. No scientist has been atop them. In fact, nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain since Schultes in '43. And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture. Let me show you what it looks like today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity, not only is it home to three isolated tribes, but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre-Colombian art in the world: over 200,000 paintings. The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast, again in the Colombian Amazon. Remember, the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England. The Amazon's a big forest, and Brazil's got a big part of it, but not all of it. Moving down to these two national parks, Cahuinari and Pure in the Colombian Amazon ― that's the Brazilian border to the right ― it's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples. To the trained eye, you can look at the roofs of these malocas, these longhouses, and see that there's cultural diversity. These are, in fact, different tribes. As isolated as these areas are, let me show you how the outside world is crowding in. Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo. With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia, the outside world is showing up. To the north, we have illegal gold mining, also from the east, from Brazil. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south, and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil. This, in the past, is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians. And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry, here's why. (Laughter) This looks like ― (Applause) This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon. This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba. A group called Los Carpinteros. This is their perception of why you shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
13:14	<br><br>
	
But the world is changing. These are Mashco-Piros on the Brazil-Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people. And in Peru, there's a very nasty business. It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. Of course, when you give them clothes, when you give them tools, you also give them diseases. We call these "inhuman safaris." These are Indians again on the Peru border, who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries. They want to get in there and turn them into Christians. We know how that turns out. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
What's to be done? Introduce technology to the contacted tribes, not the uncontacted tribes, in a culturally sensitive way. This is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology. We've done this now with over 30 tribes, mapped, managed and increased protection of over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:22	<br><br>
	
So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny. They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out. These are Indians, trained as indigenous park rangers, patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay. This is a picture of actual contact. These are Chitonahua Indians on the Brazil-Peru border. They've come out of the jungle asking for help. They were shot at, their malocas, their longhouses, were burned. Some of them were massacred. Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today, and it has to stop. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:17	<br><br>
	
But let me conclude by saying, this work can be spiritually rewarding, but it's difficult and it can be dangerous. Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane. They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes. So the question is, in conclusion, is what the future holds. These are the Uray people in Brazil. What does the future hold for them, and what does the future hold for us? Let's think differently. Let's make a better world. If the climate's going to change, let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse. Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation, in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation, can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:23	<br><br>
	
Thanks again. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:25	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>

我是名民族植物学家。 我在热带雨林工作， 记录人们如何使用当地植物。 我做这项工作很久了， 我可以告诉大家， 这些人对当地森林和里面医药珍宝的了解 比我们多得多，永远多得多。 但是，这些文化， 这些土著文化， 消失得比森林还快。 在亚马逊热带雨林中， 最伟大而最濒危的物种 不是美洲豹， 也不是美洲角雕， 而是与世隔绝的人类部落。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:50	<br><br>
	
四年前，我在爬山时伤了脚， 我去看医生。 她给我进行热疗， 进行冰疗，用阿司匹林， 用麻醉止痛剂，抗炎药， 注射可的松。 没有疗效。 几个月后， 我在亚马逊东北部， 我走进一个村落， 萨满说，“你跛了。” 这一幕我一生都不会忘记。 他看着我的脸，对我说， “脱鞋，把你的砍刀给我。” （笑声） 他走向一棵棕榈树， 切下来一片蕨， 扔到火里， 然后敷在我脚上， 然后又扔进了一壶水中， 让我把那个当茶喝了。 整整七个月，我再也没疼过。 复发后，我又去见萨满。 他对我进行同样的疗法， 现在我已经痊愈三年了。 你想让谁给你治病？ （鼓掌） 别误会 ― 西医 是人类发明的最成功的医疗体系， 但它也有缺陷。 乳腺癌的疗法在哪里？ 神经分裂症的疗法在哪里？ 胃酸倒流的疗法在哪里？ 失眠症的疗法在哪里？ 事实是，这些土著人 在有些时候，能治疗 我们治不了的病。 这是一位亚马逊东北部的药师 在治疗利什曼病。 利什曼病是一种非常恶心的原虫疾病， 全世界超过一千两百万人受其困扰。 西医的疗法是进行锑注射。 这种疗法让人很痛苦，也很昂贵， 而且这种疗法对病人的心脏也可能有副作用。 锑是重金属。 这名药师能用三种亚马逊雨林的草药来进行治疗。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:36	<br><br>
	
这个是魔蛙。 我已故的同事洛伦・麦金太尔， 他发现了亚马逊的河源湖， 秘鲁安第斯的麦金太尔湖， 他30年前在秘鲁巴西边境迷路了。 他被一群叫做Matses的与世隔绝的印第安人救了下来。 他们示意他跟随他们进入丛林，他照做了。 在那里，他们拿出了棕榈树叶筐， 里面他们拿出了这种绿色的猴蛙 ― 个头都是大家伙，有这么 ― 然后他们开始舔这种蛙。 这种蛙有高度的致幻作用。 麦金太尔把这个写了出来，《鼎盛时期》杂志的编辑看了。 从中你可以看出民族植物学家在各种奇怪的圈子都有朋友。 这名编辑决定自己去亚马逊爽一下， 舔一下，他真这样做了，他写到， “我的血压爆表了， 我对我的身体机能完全失去了控制。 我昏厥了， 六个小时后我在一张吊床里醒来， 两天内都觉得自己跟神仙似的。” （笑声） 一位意大利化学家读后说， “我对这种绿猴蛙魔幻的一面没太大兴趣， 可这个血压变化是怎么回事？” 现在，这名意大利化学家 正在研究新的治疗高血压的方法， 用的就是绿猴蛙皮肤中的肽， 而其他科学家也正在研究用这个肽来 治疗耐药性的金黄色葡萄球菌。 如果这些隔绝的印第安人和他们的魔蛙 是答案的话，那该有多讽刺。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
这里是一位亚马逊西北部的死藤水萨满， 在卡皮木仪式中。 我带他去洛杉矶见一位基金会工作人员， 寻求资金来保护他们的文化。 这个工作人员看了看这位药师，说， “你没上过医学院吧？” 萨满回答，“没有。” 他说，“那么，对治病你能懂什么？” 萨满看着他，说， “你知道么？如果你有感染，那你去看医生。 但很多人类疾病是心灵，头脑，和灵魂的病。 西医治不了。我能。” （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
但是从自然中提炼新药物也并不是那么美好。 这是条巴西毒蛇， 毒液经圣保罗大学研究， 后来发展成ACE抑制剂。 治疗高血压的尖端药物。 地球上人类每天超过10%的死亡 是因为高血压。 这是个价值40亿美元的行业， 用的就是巴西蛇的毒液， 但巴西人却一分钱也没得到。 这样的做法是不可接受的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:22	<br><br>
	
热带雨林被称作地球上最伟大的生态体系。 苏里南有一句谚语我很喜欢： “热带雨林中有我们还未知晓的问题的答案。” 但是正如大家都知道的，热带雨林正在快速消失。 在巴西是这样，在亚马逊是这样， 在全世界也是。 我从一架小飞机上拍了这张照片， 当时正在飞过Xingu土著保护区的东部边境， 是从马托格罗索州到这里的西北部。 照片的上半部分， 你能看到是印第安人的居住地。 中间的线 是保护区的东部边界。 上半部分印第安人，下半部分白人。 上半部分是奇妙的医药， 下半部分就是一群脑残。 上半部分碳被储存在他们所属的森林中， 下半部分碳排放到大气中， 导致气候变化。 事实上，大气碳排放的 第二个原因就是 森林破坏。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:21	<br><br>
	
说到破坏， 很重要的是要记得 亚马逊是最神奇的景观。 壮丽的地方，神奇的地方。 世界上最大的食蚁兽 就生活在热带雨林， 重达90磅。 巨型的捕鸟蛛， 世界上最大的蜘蛛， 也是在亚马逊。 美洲角雕翼展超过7英尺， 还有黑鳄鱼 ― 这些巨兽体重超过半吨。 他们据称能食人。 还有水蟒，最大的蛇类， 水豚，最大的啮齿类。 巴西的一个标本 重达201磅。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
让我们来看看这些生物的家园， 亚马逊东北部， Akuriyo部落的所在地。 与世隔绝的部落在我们的想象中 是神秘而有代表性的。 他们是最了解自然的人。 他们是真正与自然 和谐相处的人。 用我们的标准来看，有人会觉得他们原始。 “他们不会生火。 起码刚跟外界接触时，他们不会。” 但他们对森林的了解远远多于我们。 Akuriyos人有35种词汇形容蜂蜜， 其他印第安人将他们视为 热带雨林中真正的大师。 这是我的朋友博奈。 当我还年轻，在家乡新奥尔良 听滚石乐队的歌时， 博奈就已经在森林游牧， 漫步在亚马逊东北部的丛林中， 和小群落一起，打猎， 寻找草药， 从别的小游牧群落中 寻找配偶。 正是他们这种人有 我们不知道的智慧， 他们有很多东西能教给我们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:17	<br><br>
	
但是，如果你去亚马逊森林的大多数地方， 你见不到土著部落。 你能看到的是， 与世隔绝的土著部落磨斧头时 在石头上留下的痕迹。 这些曾经跳舞， 繁衍，赞颂神明， 崇拜森林的群落， 现在只留在岩石的痕迹中，就像这张图里的这样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:42	<br><br>
	
我们再去看看西亚马逊， 那里是与世隔绝的部落的中心。 这里每一个点都代表着 一个小的，未曾联系过的部落， 现在我们认为单单在哥伦比亚亚马逊 就有14或15个隔绝部落。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:00	<br><br>
	
为什么这些人与世隔绝？ 他们知道我们存在，他们知道有外界世界。 这是一种反抗。 他们选择保持隔绝， 我觉得他们有权利这样做。 为什么这些部落会躲着人？ 这是为什么。 很显然，部分是起源于1492年。 但是在上世纪开始出现 橡胶贸易。 对天然橡胶的需求， 而天然橡胶来自亚马逊， 促成了植物界的淘金热潮。 橡胶用于自行车胎， 橡胶用于汽车轮胎， 橡胶用于齐柏林飞艇。 橡胶被人们疯抢， 而左边这个人，朱利奥・阿拉纳， 是这个故事中最混蛋的恶棍。 他的人，他的公司， 还有其他的类似公司， 谋杀，屠杀，虐待，屠宰了Witoto等印第安部落， 幻灯片右边就是。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:56	<br><br>
	
即便在今天，当土著部落走出丛林， 故事也往往没有好的结局。 这些是Nukak人。外界80年代时与他们联络。 1年之内，40岁以上的都死了。 要记得，他们是尚无文字的社会。 长者就是图书馆。 每次一位萨满死去， 就好像一个图书馆被烧毁。 他们被逼迫离开自己的土地。 毒贩们霸占了Nukak部落的土地。 他们在哥伦比亚东部的公园中 当起了乞丐。 从Nukak部落的土地，我带你去西南部， 来到世界最壮丽的景观： 奇里维克特国家公园。 它四周环绕着三个与世隔绝的部落， 在哥伦比亚政府和哥伦比亚同僚的努力下， 国家公园范围现在扩大了。 它比马里兰州的面积还大。 它是植物多样化的宝库。 奇里维克特山最早在1943年进行了植物学探索， 探索由我的导师，理查德・舒尔特斯进行。 这里看到的是他在贝尔山的顶端， 贝尔山是Karijona部落的圣山。 让我带你看看现在那里是什么样。 飞跃奇里维克特山， 这些与世隔绝的山仍旧是与世隔绝的。 没有科学家登顶过。 事实上，自舒尔特斯1943年以来， 再也没有人登顶过贝尔山。 我们前面就是贝尔山， 就在画面东部。 让我带你们看看它现在的样子。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
它不仅仅是植物多样化的宝库， 也不仅仅是三个与世隔绝部落的家园， 它还是世界上最伟大的 前哥伦布时期的艺术宝库， 拥有超过20万幅画作。 荷兰科学家托马斯・范德哈门 称其为亚马逊热带雨林的西斯廷圣母院。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
从奇里维克特山向东南方去， 回到哥伦比亚亚马逊。 请记得，哥伦比亚亚马逊比新英格兰面积还广。 亚马逊是一大片森林， 巴西有很大一部分， 但不是全部。 来到这两个国家公园， 位于哥伦比亚亚马逊的 卡维纳里河国家公园和普伦国家公园 ― 右边是巴西边境 ― 是许多与世隔绝的部落 的家园。 如果你有能力，你能看出 这些是长屋的房顶， 看出那里的文化多样性。 这些其实是不同的部落。 尽管这些地方如此隔绝， 我来给你们看外界是如何进行侵蚀的。 这里，我们能看到普图马约河的贸易和运输增长。 随着哥伦比亚内战的结束， 外界开始侵入。 北边，有非法的金矿， 东边来自巴西的也有。 商业目的的狩猎和捕鱼活动也越来越多。 南边我们能看到非法采木， 毒贩子也想穿过国家公园 去巴西。 这就是为什么在过去，你别惹 与世隔绝的印第安人。 如果这张照片看起来有点失焦， 因为拍摄的时候匆匆忙忙，而这就是为什么。 （笑声） 这看起来像 ― （掌声） 这看起来像是在巴西亚马逊的机库。 这其实是古巴哈瓦那的艺术展， 创作自一个叫做“Los Carpinteros”的组织。 这是他们想象中的你为什么别惹与世隔绝的的印第安人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:14	<br><br>
	
但是世界在变化。 这些是Mashco-Piro人在巴西秘鲁边境， 他们逃出丛林 因为他们被驱赶出来， 被毒贩和采木的人。 在秘鲁，有个很邪恶的行业 叫人类游猎。 他们带你去隔绝部落照相。 当然，你给他们衣服，给他们工具， 你也带给他们疾病。 我们管这个叫“反人类游猎”。 这又是印第安人，在秘鲁边境， 被传教士带着飞到这里。 传教士想把他们变成基督徒。 我们都知道这样做的结果。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
能做些什么？ 传播科技给已经有联系的部落， 不是隔绝的部落， 并在传播过程中照顾到他们的文化。 这是古老的萨满智慧与 21世纪科技的完美联姻。 我们已经跟超过30个部落合作了。 我们测绘了，管理了，并加强保护了 超过七千万英亩的古老热带雨林。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:22	<br><br>
	
这能让印第安人掌控 他们的环境和文化未来。 他们还设立了岗哨房， 不让外人进入。 这些是印第安人，经过受训成为巡山人， 在边境巡逻， 防止外部世界进入。 这是与部落接触时的照片。 他们是Chitonahua印第安部落， 位于巴西秘鲁边境。 他们从丛林中走出， 寻求帮助。 他们遭到枪击， 他们的长屋被焚毁。 他们有的人被屠杀。 使用自动化武器对付这些与世隔绝的部落 是我们地球上如今最可耻最可恶的 反人类行径，这一行径必须停止。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:17	<br><br>
	
在结尾，请让我说， 这一工作对心灵是很有好处的， 但也是困难的，还会是很危险的。 我的两个同事最近刚刚去世， 死于小型飞机坠毁。 他们在保护森林， 保卫这些隔绝的部落。 那么在结尾，问题是， 未来会怎么样。 这些是巴西的Uray部落。 他们的未来会怎样。 我们的未来会怎样？ 让我们换个想法。 让我们一起建立一个更好的世界。 如果气候变化一定要发生， 那就让气候变好，而不是变坏。 让我们所生活的星球上 充满丰富的植被， 而隔绝的部落 能够保持隔绝， 能够继续那份神秘， 还有那些智慧， 如果他们愿意这样。 让我们所生活的世界里， 萨满生活在树林中， 用他们神秘的植物 和神圣的猴蛙， 治疗他们，还有我们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:23	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:25	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Hidden music rituals around the world</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Vincent Moon travels the world with a backpack and a camera, filming astonishing music and ritual the world rarely sees ― from a powerful Sufi ritual in Chechnya to an ayahuasca journey in Peru. He hopes his films can help people see their own cultures in a new way, to make young people say: "Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyonce." Followed by a mesmerizing performance by jazz icon Nana Vasconcelos. 	<br><br>

Vincent Moon: How can we use computers, cameras, microphones to represent the world in an alternative way, as much as possible? How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema? And actually, why do we record? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:36	<br><br>
	
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films 10 years ago, first with a friend, Christophe Abric. He had a website, La Blogotheque, dedicated to independent music. We were crazy about music. We wanted to represent music in a different way, to film the music we love, the musicians we admired, as much as possible, far from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it. We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet. We are going to see a few extracts now. 	<br><br>
 	
	
1:16	<br><br>
	
From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe. From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower to Tom Jones in his hotel room in New York. From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympiades to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn. From R.E.M. in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France. From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night, and many, many, many more unknown or very famous bands. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:13	<br><br>
	
We published all those films for free on the Internet, and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way. We wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. At the time, 10 years ago actually, there was no such project on the Internet, and I guess that's why the project we were making, the Take Away Shows, got quite successful, reaching millions of viewers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
After a while, I got a bit ― I wanted to go somewhere else. I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music, to explore the world, going to other corners, and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema, sort of, that I had in mind. How could the use of new technologies and the road fit together? How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes? So I went on five-year travels around the globe. I started at the time in the digital film and music label collection Petites Planetes, which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker. We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films. 	<br><br>
	
	
3:34	<br><br>
	
From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya. From experimental electronic music in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Ze singing on his rooftop in Sao Paolo. From The Bambir, the great rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia. From White Shoes, a great retro pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary band from Kiev, Ukraine. From Tomi Lebrero and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to many other places and musicians around the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
My desire was to make it as a trek. To do all those films, it would have been impossible with a big company behind me, with a structure or anything. I was traveling alone with a backpack ― computer, camera, microphones in it. Alone, actually, but just with local people, meeting my team, which was absolutely not professional people, on the spot there, going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing: I want to make a film and you're going to give me a place to stay for the night. I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha. Well, or other drinks, depending on where you are. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:31	<br><br>
	
In Peru, they drink pisco sour. Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually, I had no idea about what I would do there. And I just had one phone number, actually, of one person. Three months later, after traveling all around the country, I had recorded 33 films, only with the help of local people, only with the help of people that I was asking all the time the same question: What is important to record here today? By living in such a way, by working without any structure, I was able to react to the moment and to decide, oh, this is important to make now. This is important to record that whole person. This is important to create this exchange. When I went to Chechnya, the first person I met looked at me and was like, "What are you doing here? Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics? What kind of problems are you going to study?" Well, I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually ― incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya, which is absolutely unknown outside of the region. As soon as people understood that I would give them those films ― I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license, but I would also really give them to the people and I would let them do what they want with it. I just want to represent them in a beautiful light. I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather, and they're going to be like, "Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyonce." (Laughter) It's a really important thing. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
It's really important, because that's the way people are going to look differently at their own culture, at their own land. They're going to think about it differently. It may be a way to maintain a certain diversity. Why you will record? Hmm. There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says, "Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance." It's a really good sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images. What's the point of that? Where do we go with it? I was researching. I was still keeping this idea in mind: What's the point? I was researching on music, trying to pull, trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. Where is this all coming from? I am French. I had no idea about what I would discover, which is a very simple thing: Everything was sacred, at first, and music was spiritual healing. How could I use my camera, my little tool, to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent, a cine-trance, maybe, something in complete harmony with the people? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:01	<br><br>
	
That is now my new research I'm doing on spirituality, on new spirits around the world. Maybe a few more extracts now. From the Tana Toraja funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony in the north of Ethiopia. From jathilan, a popular trance ritual on the island of Java, to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest church of Armenia. Some Sufi songs in Harar, the holy city of Ethiopia, to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of Peru with the Shipibo. Then to my new project, the one I'm doing now here in Brazil, named "Hibridos." I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon. It's research on the new spiritualities all around the country. This is my quest, my own little quest of what I call experimental ethnography, trying to hybrid all those different genres, trying to regain a certain complexity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:52	<br><br>
	
Why do we record? I was still there. I really believe cinema teaches us to see. The way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world, and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible, terrible job at representing the world: violence, extremists, only spectacular events, only simplifications of everyday life. I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity. To reinvent life today, we have to make new forms of images. And it's very simple. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:39	<br><br>
	
Muito obrigado. 	<br><br>

11:53	<br><br>
	
Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent. Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance, and I have a question for you, and the question is this: You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us, and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. You walk into sacred rituals, private moments in a village, a town, a group of people. How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:29	<br><br>
	
VM: I think you break it with your body, more than with your knowledge. That's what it taught me to travel, to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain. The respect is stepping forward, not stepping backward, and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment, in the ceremony, in the places, people welcome you and understand your energy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:54	<br><br>
	
BG: You told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot. You don't do much editing. I mean, you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length, etc. Otherwise, you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning, and so is that the case? It's correct? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:12	<br><br>
	
VM: My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut, in a way, as long as we let the viewer watch, more and more viewers are going to feel closer, are going to get closer to the moment, to that moment and to that place. I really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer, to not cut all the time from one place to another, to just let the time go. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:40	<br><br>
	
BG: Tell me in a few words about your new project, "Hibridos," here in Brazil. Just before coming to TEDGlobal, you have actually been traveling around the country for that. Tell us a couple of things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:50	<br><br>
	
VM: "Hibridos" is ― I really believe Brazil, far from the cliches, is the greatest religious country in the world, the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities. And it's a big project I'm doing over this year, which is researching in very different regions of Brazil, in very different forms of cults, and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:15	<br><br>
	
BG: The man who is going to appear onstage momentarily, and Vincent's going to introduce him, is one of the subjects of one of his past videos. When did you do a video with him? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:26	<br><br>
	
VM: I guess four years ago, four years in my first travel. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:31	<br><br>
	
BG: So it was one of your first ones in Brazil. VM: It was amongst the first ones in Brazil, yeah. I shot the film in Recife, in the place where he is from. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:40	<br><br>
	
BG: So let's introduce him. Who are we waiting for? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
VM: I'll just make it very short. It's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian musicians of all time. Please welcome Nana Vasconcelos. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:52	<br><br>
	
BG: Nana Vasconcelos! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:01	<br><br>
	
(Music) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:18	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">What your doctor won’t disclose</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Wouldn’t you want to know if your doctor was a paid spokesman for a drug company? Or held personal beliefs incompatible with the treatment you want? Right now, in the US at least, your doctor simply doesn’t have to tell you about that. And when physician Leana Wen asked her fellow doctors to open up, the reaction she got was … unsettling. 	<br><br>

They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession, that I should be fired, have my medical license taken away, that I should go back to my own country. My email got hacked. In a discussion forum for other doctors, someone took credit for "Twitter-bombing" my account. Now, I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing, but then came the response: "Too bad it wasn't a real bomb." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:43	<br><br>
	
I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors. Becoming a doctor was my dream. I grew up in China, and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week. I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam, who always took care of me. She was about the same age as my mother. She had this wild, curly hair, and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses. She was one of those doctors who, if you fell and you broke your arm, she would ask you why you weren't laughing because it's your humerus. Get it? See, you'd groan, but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her. Well, we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like, right? Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. When I was eight, my parents and I moved to the U.S., and ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well, eventually I learned enough English, and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:57	<br><br>
	
But then one day, everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well, she had a cough that wouldn't go away, she was short of breath and tired. Well, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter, I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was: We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer, cancer that by then had spread to her lungs, her bones, and her brain. My mother was brave, though, and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation, and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it, but she found something else too. On several websites, he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company, and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic, and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her, but maybe it wasn't. It made her scared and it made her doubt. When it comes to medicine, having that trust is a must, and when that trust is gone, then all that's left is fear. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:10	<br><br>
	
There's another side to this fear. As a medical student, I was taking care of this 19-year-old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit, run over by an SUV. He had seven broken ribs, shattered hip bones, and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain. Now, imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle, 2,000 miles away, to find their son in a coma. I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right? They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan, which I thought was a reasonable request, and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared. The head doctor, though, said no. He gave all kinds of reasons. Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way. Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions. He even said, "What if they see mistakes and sue us?" What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear, and what I learned was that to become a doctor, we have to put on our white coats, put up a wall, and hide behind it. There's a hidden epidemic in medicine. Of course, patients are scared when they come to the doctor. Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache, you go to the hospital, you're lying in this strange place, you're on this hospital gurney, you're wearing this flimsy gown, strangers are coming to poke and prod at you. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago. But it's not just patients who are scared; doctors are scared too. We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about. And so what do we do? We put on our white coats and we hide behind them. Of course, the more we hide, the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding. The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care. We don't just have a fear of sickness, we have a sickness of fear. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:06	<br><br>
	
Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do? Can we overcome the sickness of fear? Let me ask you differently: If hiding isn't the answer, what if we did the opposite? What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
Last fall, I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare. I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital, but everyday people. So my two medical students, Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns, literally took their research to the streets. They went to banks, coffee shops, senior centers, Chinese restaurants and train stations. What did they find? Well, when we asked people, "What do you want to know about your healthcare?" people responded with what they want to know about their doctors, because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. When we asked, "What do you want to know about your doctors?" people gave three different answers. Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine. Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science, not on who pays them. Surprisingly to us, many people want to know something else about their doctors. Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student, says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health. Serena, a 32-year-old accountant, says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights. Frank, a 59-year-old hardware store owner, doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first, but who is comfortable with alternative treatments. One after another, our respondents told us that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one ― that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets, they want to first understand their doctor's values. Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:19	<br><br>
	
As a result of this, I formed a campaign, Who's My Doctor? that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in, but also our conflicts of interest. We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations, and we talk about how we're paid. Incentives matter. If you go to your doctor because of back pain, you might want to know he's getting paid 5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery versus 25 dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist, or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends. Then, we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health, LGBT health, alternative medicine, preventive health, and end-of-life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you, so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't, but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor? Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic. Here are a few. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
From a gastroenterologist in Portland: "I devoted 12 years of my life to being a slave. I have loans and mortgages. I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients." Well, times may be hard for everyone, but try telling your patient making 35,000 dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:01	<br><br>
	
From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte: "I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from. My patients don't disclose their incomes to me." But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:16	<br><br>
	
From a psychiatrist in New York City: "Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs, what model of car we drive, and what toilet paper we use." Well, how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health, but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end-of-life decisions just might. And my favorite, from a Kansas City cardiologist: "More government-mandated stuff? Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country." Well, two pieces of good news. First of all, this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory, and second of all, I'm American and I'm already here. (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:04	<br><br>
	
Within a month, my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired. I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me. My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign. After the bomb threat, I was done. But then I heard from patients. Over social media, a TweetChat, which I'd learned what that was by then, generated 4.3 million impressions, and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue. They wrote with things like, "If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of, they shouldn't be doing it." "Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions. Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. Why shouldn't doctors?" And finally, many people wrote and said, "Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor." In our initial trial, over 300 doctors have taken the total transparency pledge. What a crazy new idea, right? But actually, this is not that new of a concept at all. Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China, with the goofy jokes and the wild hair? Well, she was my doctor, but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. I went to the same school as her daughter. My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for, and she had no need to hide from us. Just one generation ago, this was the norm in the U.S. as well. You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys, that he quit smoking a few years ago, that he says he's a regular churchgoer, but you see him twice a year: once at Easter and once when his mother-in-law comes to town. You knew what he was about, and he had no need to hide from you. But the sickness of fear has taken over, and patients suffer the consequences. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:58	<br><br>
	
I know this firsthand. My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner, and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives, she wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough, how it was time for her to go. One day, when I was a resident physician, I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit. By the time I got there, she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine. "But this is not what she wants," I said, "and we have documents." The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye, pointed at my then 16-year-old sister, and said, "Do you remember when you were that age? How would you have liked to grow up without your mother?" Her oncologist was there too, and said, "This is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her?" I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well, but I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made, to let her die in peace, and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:22	<br><br>
	
We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there, because we've been there before, and we know that transparency gets us to that trust. Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors, that having open medical records, being willing to talk about medical errors, will increase patient trust, improve health outcomes, and reduce malpractice. That openness, that trust, is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease. Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy, but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices, to address issues like smoking cessation, blood-pressure management and diabetes control, well, that requires us to establish trust. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
Here's what other transparent doctors have said. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:12	<br><br>
	
Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver: "This has brought me closer to my patients. The type of relationship I've developed ― that's why I entered medicine." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:25	<br><br>
	
Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver: "I tell my patients that I am totally open with them. I don't hide anything from them. This is me. Now tell me about you. We're in this together." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:38	<br><br>
	
May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston: "My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing. They ask me how I could be so brave. I said, I'm not being brave, it's my job." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
I leave you today with a final thought. Being totally transparent is scary. You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable, but that vulnerability, that humility, it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine. When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals, take off our white coats, and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about, that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear. That's when we establish trust. That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:34	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums. Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution ― one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit. 	<br><br>

If there's any power in design, that's the power of synthesis. The more complex the problem, the more the need for simplicity. So allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design's power of synthesis. 	<br><br>

Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization. It's a fact that people are moving towards cities. and even if counterintuitive, it's good news. Evidence shows that people are better off in cities. But there's a problem that I would call the "3S" menace: The scale, speed, and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history. For you to have an idea, out of the three billion people living in cities today, one billion are under the line of poverty. By 2030, out of the five billion people that will be living in cities, two billion are going to be under the line of poverty. That means that we will have to build a one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family during the next 15 years. A one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family. If we don't solve this equation, it is not that people will stop coming to cities. They will come anyhow, but they will live in slums, favelas and informal settlements. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
So what to do? Well, an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves. A clue could be in this question we were asked 10 years ago. We were asked to accommodate 100 families that had been occupying illegally half a hectare in the center of the city of Iquique in the north of Chile using a $10,000 subsidy with which we had to buy the land, provide the infrastructure, and build the houses that, in the best of the cases, would be of around 40 square meters. And by the way, they said, the cost of the land, because it's in the center of the city, is three times more than what social housing can normally afford. Due to the difficulty of the question, we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints, and we started a participatory design process, and testing what was available there in the market. Detached houses, 30 families could be accommodated. Row houses, 60 families. ["100 families"] The only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height, and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution, because they could not make the tiny apartments expand. So the conclusion with the families ― and this is important, not our conclusion ― with the families, was that we had a problem. We had to innovate. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:30	<br><br>
	
So what did we do? Well, a middle-class family lives reasonably well in around 80 square meters, but when there's no money, what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to 40 square meters. What we said was, what if, instead of thinking of 40 square meters as a small house, why don't we consider it half of a good one? When you rephrase the problem as half of a good house instead of a small one, the key question is, which half do we do? And we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won't be able to do individually. We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house, and we went back to the families to do two things: join forces and split tasks. Our design was something in between a building and a house. As a building, it could pay for expensive, well-located land, and as a house, it could expand. If, in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house, families kept their network and their jobs, we knew that the expansion would begin right away. So we went from this initial social housing to a middle-class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:19	<br><br>
	
This was our first project in Iquique 10 years ago. This is our last project in Chile. Different designs, same principle: You provide the frame, and from then on, families take over. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
So the purpose of design, trying to understand and trying to give an answer to the "3S" menace, scale, speed, and scarcity, is to channel people's own building capacity. We won't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people's own power for building. So, with the right design, slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution. The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability. In 2012, we entered the competition for the Angelini Innovation Center, and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation. It is accepted that for such an aim, knowledge creation, interaction among people, face-to-face contact, it's important, and we agreed on that. But for us, the question of the right environment was a very literal question. We wanted to have a working space with the right light, with the right temperature, with the right air. So we asked ourselves: Does the typical office building help us in that sense? Well, how does that building look, typically? It's a collection of floors, one on top of each other, with a core in the center with elevators, stairs, pipes, wires, everything, and then a glass skin on the outside that, due to direct sun radiation, creates a huge greenhouse effect inside. In addition to that, let's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day through the third floor, but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on. So we thought, well, maybe we have to turn this scheme inside out. And what we did was, let's have an open atrium, a hollowed core, the same collection of floors, but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter, so that when the sun hits, it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall. When you have an open atrium inside, you are able to see what others are doing from within the building, and you have a better way to control light, and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter, then you are preventing direct sun radiation. You may also open those windows and get cross-ventilation. We just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares, outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building. None of this is rocket science. You don't require sophisticated programming. It's not about technology. This is just archaic, primitive common sense, and by using common sense, we went from 120 kilowatts per square meter per year, which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower, to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year. So with the right design, sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common sense. Last case I would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters. You may know that Chile, in 2010, was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale earthquake and tsunami, and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the Constitución, in the southern part of the country. We were given 100 days, three months, to design almost everything, from public buildings to public space, street grid, transportation, housing, and mainly how to protect the city against future tsunamis. This was new in Chilean urban design, and there were in the air a couple of alternatives. First one: Forbid installation on ground zero. Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation. This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays, and if you have a disciplined population like the Japanese, this may work, but we know that in Chile, this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow, so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable. Second alternative: build a big wall, heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves. This alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies, because it meant 42 million dollars in contracts, and was also politically preferred, because it required no land expropriation. But Japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless. So this alternative was irresponsible. As in the housing process, we had to include the community in the way of finding a solution for this, and we started a participatory design process. 	<br><br>

(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker: What kind of city do you want? Vote for Constitución. Go to the Open House and express your options. Participate! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:11	<br><br>
	
Fisherman: I am a fisherman. Twenty-five fishermen work for me. Where should I take them? To the forest? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense? Done well, of course. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:23	<br><br>
	
Man 2: I am the history of Constitución. And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here? My whole family has lived here, I raised my children here, and my children will also raise their children here. and my grandchildren and everyone else will. But why are you imposing this on me? You! You are imposing this on me! In danger zone I am not authorized to build. He himself is saying that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:45	<br><br>
	
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves... 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:49	<br><br>
	
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles, but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie, romantic, let's-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city kind of thing. It is actually ― (Applause) It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer. It is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question. There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
So it was pretty obvious after this process that, well, we chicken out here and go away because it's too tense, or we go even further in asking, what else is bothering you? What other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch? And what they said was, look, fine to protect the city against future tsunamis, we really appreciate, but the next one is going to come in, what, 20 years? But every single year, we have problems of flooding due to rain. In addition, we are in the middle of the forest region of the country, and our public space sucks. It's poor and it's scarce. And the origin of the city, our identity, is not really connected to the buildings that fell, it is connected to the river, but the river cannot be accessed publicly, because its shores are privately owned. So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative, and our approach was against geographical threats, have geographical answers. What if, in between the city and the sea we have a forest, a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature, but dissipates it by introducing friction? A forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding? That may pay the historical debt of public space, and that may provide, finally, democratic access to the river. So as a conclusion of the participatory design, the alternative was validated politically and socially, but there was still the problem of the cost: 48 million dollars. So what we did was a survey in the public investment system, and found out that there were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place, not knowing of the existence of the other projects. The sum of them: 52 million dollars. So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities, which is not money but coordination. By doing so, we were able to save four million dollars, and that is why the forest is today under construction. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:08	<br><br>
	
So be it the force of self construction, the force of common sense, or the force of nature, all these forces need to be translated into form, and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement, bricks, or wood. It is life itself. Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:41	<br><br>
	
Thank you so much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:43	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
如果说设计有任何力量的话， 那就是整合的力量。 问题越复杂， 就越需要简化。 请允许我分享三个案例， 我们尝试在其中运用 设计的“整合力”。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
[案例一：城市] 让我们从城市化这个全球性的挑战说起。 事实是人们在向城市迁移， 也许有悖常理，但其实这是好消息。 证据表明人们在城市中生活得更好。 但这里有一个问题， 我将它称之为“3S威胁“： 规模，速度和资源匮乏， 即在城市化过程中，我们面对的这三个威胁 是史无前例的。 这是什么概念呢？ 在今天居住在城市的三十亿人中， 有十亿人是生活在贫困线以下的。 到2030年，预计有五十亿人 会居住在城市， 在他们中，有二十亿会生活在贫困线以下。 这意味着，在未来的十五年内， 我们必须每周建造一座 能容纳一百万人的城市， 平均每个家庭投入一万美元。 每周一座百万人口的城市， 每个家庭一万美元。 如果我们不解决这个问题， 人们并不会因此不来城市， 他们还是会来， 但他们会住在棚户区，贫民窟 和不正规的定居点中 。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
那么我们该怎么办？ 棚户区和贫民窟本身或许可以给我们答案。 在我们十年前被问到的一个问题中 可能就含有答案。 我们被要求为100个家庭提供住所， 他们非法占据了 半公顷的在智利北部的伊基克的市中心土地。 我们有一万美元的补助， 用这些钱，我们必须购买土地， 提供基础设施 和建造住房， 这些住房最多也就大约四十平米。 “对了”，他们说， “土地的价格――由于在市中心―― 可能会比一般社会住房可承担的价格贵三倍。” 因为这个问题的复杂性， 我们决定把那些家庭也包括进来 并一起了解这些限制， 我们启动了一个用户参与式设计流程 并且检验了市场上可以购买到的房屋。 独栋房屋 可以容纳三十个家庭； 排屋，六十个。 [一百个家庭] 唯一能容纳所有人的方法 就是增加高度， 但是他们用绝食来威胁我们， 如果我们敢把这当作一个解决方案的话， 因为他们不能扩建这些狭小的公寓。 [结论？我们遇到麻烦了] 所以，我们一起得出的结论―― 这一点是重要的，这不是我们的结论， 这是我们一起得出的结论――就是我们遇到麻烦了。 我们必须创新 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:30	<br><br>
	
那我们是怎么做的呢? 一个中产阶级的家庭 在一间大约八十平米的房子里会生活得不错。 但当资金不足时， 市场会把房子的面积 缩减到四十平米。 我们的想法是 如果 我们不把一间四十平米的房子 视作一间狭小的房子， 为什么不将它当作 一间好的房子的一半？ 当你把这个问题说成半间好房子 而不是一间小房子时， 问题就变成了，我们要建造哪一半？ 我们想，我们必须用公共资金 建造那些家庭无法单独建造的那一半。 我们确认了五个设计条件， 它们都属于建造一座房子中困难的那部分， 然后我们回头找到那些家庭去做两件事： 联合力量和分派任务。 我们的设计是一个 介于一栋楼和一个房子之间的东西。 作为一栋楼，它可以承担 昂贵的，地段良好的土地的价格， 作为一个房子，它可以扩展。 这些家庭不用到城市边缘寻求房子， 如果他们保持他们原有的的社交关系和工作， 我们知道扩建很快就会开始。 所以我们从起初的社会住房 发展成了由那些家庭自己打造的中产阶层单元房， 就在几周的时间内。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:19	<br><br>
	
这是我们第一个项目， 十年前在伊基克。 这是我们在智利的最近一个项目， 不同的设计，相同的原则。 你提供框架， 然后由家庭接手。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
所以，设计的目的， 试图理解和解决“3S”威胁， 即规模（scale），速度（speed） 和匮乏（scarcity）， 就是启发人们自身的建造的能力， 如果我们不利用人们自己的力量， 我们就无法解决这个每周为一百万人提供住房的问题。 所以，有了正确的设计， 贫民窟和棚户区可能就不再是问题了， 而是唯一可能的解决方案。 案例二：CO2（二氧化碳） 第二个案例体现了设计是如何 对可持续性起到帮助的。 在2012年，我们参与了安杰利尼创新中心的竞标， 我们的目标是为知识的创造提供合适的环境。 有一点是公认的， 那就是对于知识创造这样一个目标来说， 人与人之间面对面的交流和互动是很重要的， 我们也同意这点。 但对于我们，合适的环境 其实就是一个表面的问题。 我们想打造一个有着合适光线和 适宜的温度和空气的工作空间。 于是我们问自己， 典型的办公建筑 是否在这些方面对我们有帮助？ 这些建筑看上去一般是什么样的？ 它是许多楼层的集合， 层层相叠， 在中间有一个核心， 其中有电梯，楼梯，管道，线路等等， 外部有一层玻璃外墙， 因为阳光的直射， 在内部制造了严重的温室效应。 另外， 就拿一个在七楼工作的人来说， 他每天都要经过三楼， 但他对在那层的人的工作一无所知。 于是我们想，好吧，或许我们应该把这个设计反一下。 我们所做是 让我们建造一个开放的中庭， 一个空的中轴， 同样的楼层的集合， 但把外墙和其他东西安排在四周， 所以当阳光照射时， 不直接照在玻璃上，而是在墙上。 当你在内部有了一个开放的中庭时， 你就可以从内部看到别人在做什么， 你也可以更好的控制光线， 另外当你把杂物和墙壁 放在外围时， 你就可以阻止阳光的直射。 你也可以打开那些窗户 让穿堂风通过。 我们设计了这种大规模的开放空间， 它们成了整个建筑的空中广场和户外空间。 这些都不是什么尖端科技， 你不需要做复杂的规划， 这些都无关技术， 这只是一种古老的，原始的常识。 通过运用这些常识 我们把这座大楼用于降温的能耗 从一座传统的玻璃幕墙建筑的 每平米每年120千瓦 降到了每平米每年40千瓦。 所以，有了正确的设计 可持续性就不过是对常识的严格运用。 [案例三：海啸] 我想分享的最后一个案例 是关于设计可以如何为对抗自然灾害 提供一个全面的答案。 你们或许知道，智利在2010年 被一场里氏8.8级的地震和海啸袭击， 我们被叫去参与 南部的孔斯蒂图西翁市的重建工作。 我们有100天时间，大约三个月， 来设计出几乎所有的东西， 从公共建筑到公共空间， 街道网络，交通，住房， 以及最主要的―― 保护城市抵御未来海啸的方法。 这在智利的城市设计中是前所未有的， 当时还有三个其他的选项。 第一， 禁止在危险区域内的建设 如果这样做，政府需要花三千万美元在征地上。 这个方案正是现在在日本被讨论的， 如果你的民众像日本民众一样遵守秩序， 那这个方案或许可行。 但是我们知道，在智利 这些土地是无论如何都会被非法占据的， 所以，这个方案既不现实也不理想。 第二个选项：修建一堵巨大的墙， 用坚固的结构来抵御洪水的力量。 大型建筑公司极力游说此方案， 因为这能带来4200万美元的合同， 而且这在政治上也是首选的， 因为它并不需要任何征地项目。 但是日本的经验证明了 想要去抵抗自然的力量是徒劳的， 所以这个方案是不负责任的。 就像在住房项目中一样， 我们必须让社区参与到 为这个问题寻找方案的过程中来， 我们启动了一个参与式设计流程。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:03	<br><br>
	
（录像）[西班牙语] 扩音器：你们想要什么样的城市？ 为孔斯蒂图西翁投票， 参加开放日， 发表你的意见， 参与进来！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:11	<br><br>
	
渔民：我是一个渔民， 手下有二十五个人， 我该带他们去哪里？去森林吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
男子：我们为什么不可以建水泥堤坝？ 当然了，要修建好。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:23	<br><br>
	
男子2：我祖上就住在这里， 而你们现在告诉我我不能继续住在这里？ 我的全家都一直住在这里， 我在这里抚养我的孩子们长大， 我的孩子们也会在这里抚养他们的孩子， 我的孙子们和后代所有人都会在这里， 但你们为什么要强迫我？ 你！你们就是在强迫我！ 说什么在危险区，我不能盖房子， 他，他自己就是这样说的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:45	<br><br>
	
男子3：不，不，不，不是…… 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:49	<br><br>
	
演讲者：我不知道你们是否能看懂字幕， 但是你们可以从肢体语言判断 这个参与式设计 不是一个嬉皮的，浪漫的 “大家一起梦想城市的未来”之类的事情， 它实际上 ――（掌声） 它实际上甚至不是要和那些家庭一起 尝试寻找正确答案， 而主要是要明确 什么才是恰当的问题。 没有什么比正确回答一个错误的问题更糟糕的了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
很明显，在这之后 我们应该畏缩离开，因为气氛太紧张了？ 还是我们更进一步 去问“还有什么别的事情困扰你们吗？” “你们还有什么其它问题？” “既然这座城市要从零开始重新规划， 你们还有什么想让我们帮忙解决的吗？” 他们说， 好，保护城市抵御海啸是好事， 我们很感激这一点， 但是下一场海啸什么时候会来？二十年后？ 但每一年，我们都会遇到由降雨带来的洪水， 另外，我们处在这个国家的森林地区， 我们的公共空间糟透了， 条件差而且非常有限。 而且这座城市的根源，我们的认同感 和那些倒掉的建筑并没有什么关系， 而是和河流相连的， 但河流是不对公众开放的， 因为河岸是被私人所有的。 所以我们认为我们必须想出第三个方案 我们的想法是，应对地方性的威胁 需要有地方性的答案。 如果 在城市和海洋之间 有一片树林， 这片树林并不是用来阻止 自然的力量的， 而是通过引入障碍来削弱它？ 一片森林或许可以分开水流 并且避免洪水？ 它或许也可以解决公共空间的历史问题， 并且最终 为公众提供一条开放的河流。 所以，作为参与式设计的结论， 这个方案在政治上和社会上都是可行的， 但成本的问题依然存在， 4800万美元. 我们对公共投资系统做了一个调查， 我们发现这里有三个不同的部门 在同一个地方有三个彼此独立的项目， 他们都不知道对方的存在， 而这些项目的成本总和是：5200万美元。 所以，“设计的整合力” 就是尝试去高效地利用城市中稀缺的资源， 这无关金钱，而是协调。 通过这样做，我们能节省 四百万美元，这也是为什么 那片森林现在已经在种植了。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:08	<br><br>
	
所以，自我建造的力量， 常识的力量， 或自然的力量，所有这些力量 需要被转化成一种形式， 而这种形式最终打造的 并不是水泥，砖块或木材， 而是生活本身。 设计的整合力 不过是一种 把生命的力量注入建筑的灵魂的努力尝试。 谢谢！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:42	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>

We all want to use our talents to create something meaningful with our lives. But how to get started? (And ... what if you're shy?) Writer Kare Anderson shares her own story of chronic shyness, and how she opened up her world by helping other people use their own talents and passions. 	<br><br>
Kare Anderson	<br><br>
  Nov 2014	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy, and, like at least 20 other people in a room of this size, I was a stutterer. Do you dare raise your hand? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us, because when we are treated that way, we feel invisible sometimes, or talked around and at. And as I started to look at people, which is mostly all I did, I noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition. Remember, I was young then. So what did they do? What we still do perhaps too often. We talk about ourselves. And yet there are other people I observed who had what I called a mutuality mindset. In each situation, they found a way to talk about us and create that "us" idea. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:16	<br><br>
	
So my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater opportunity-makers with and for others. There's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become opportunity-makers who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own. And I want to talk to you about that, because even more than giving, even more than giving, is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale. That's why I'm sitting here. But I also want to point something else out: Each one of you is better than anybody else at something. That disproves that popular notion that if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:23	<br><br>
	
So let me tell you about a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back, and I met this up-and-coming actress, and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about: public art. And she had the fervent belief that every new building in Los Angeles should have public art in it. She wanted a regulation for it, and she fervently started ― who is here from Chicago? ― she fervently started talking about these bean-shaped reflective sculptures in Millennium Park, and people would walk up to it and they'd smile in the reflection of it, and they'd pose and they'd vamp and they'd take selfies together, and they'd laugh. And as she was talking, a thought came to my mind. I said, "I know someone you ought to meet. He's getting out of San Quentin in a couple of weeks" ― (Laughter) ― "and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect." He spent five years in solitary, and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin, and he's articulate and he's rather easy on the eyes because he's buff. He had workout regime he did every day. (Laughter) I think she was following me at that point. I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally." And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor, and he loves place-making, and place-making is when you have those mini-plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art, where people draw and come up and talk sometimes. I think they'd make good allies. And indeed they were. They met together. They prepared. They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council. And the council members not only passed the regulation, half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards. They were startling, compelling and credible. You can't buy that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
What I'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity- makers we might become, because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect around each other's better side and bring it out. And I'm not saying this is easy, and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with, but what I want to suggest is, this is an opportunity. I started thinking about it way back when I was a Wall Street Journal reporter and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended business or politics or lifestyle. So I had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine, because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends. And third, I had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader's shoes, so they could see how these trends could affect their lives. That's what opportunity-makers do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
And here's a strange thing: Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme, opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them, and they're building relationships, and because they do that, they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster and seize more opportunities. They're not affronted by differences, they're fascinated by them, and that is a huge shift in mindset, and once you feel it, you want it to happen a lot more. This world is calling out for us to have a collective mindset, and I believe in doing that. It's especially important now. Why is it important now? Because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection, and they can be devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then, as we know from the news every day, they can be used for dangerous ones. It calls on us, each of us, to a higher calling. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:00	<br><br>
	
But here's the icing on the cake: It's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that's probably your greatest, as an institution or an individual. It's after you've had that experience and you trust each other. It's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted. For example, Marty is the husband of that actress I mentioned, and he watched them when they were practicing, and he was soon talking to Wally, my friend the ex-con, about that exercise regime. And he thought, I have a set of racquetball courts. That guy could teach it. A lot of people who work there are members at my courts. They're frequent travelers. They could practice in their hotel room, no equipment provided. That's how Wally got hired. Not only that, years later he was also teaching racquetball. Years after that, he was teaching the racquetball teachers. What I'm suggesting is, when you connect with people around a shared interest and action, you're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future, and I think that's what we're looking at. We open ourselves up to those opportunities, and in this room are key players and technology, key players who are uniquely positioned to do this, to scale systems and projects together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:29	<br><br>
	
So here's what I'm calling for you to do. Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers. Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers. They get involved in different worlds than their worlds so they're trusted and they can see those patterns, and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest. 	<br><br>

So what I'm asking you is, the world is hungry. I truly believe, in my firsthand experience, the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity-makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do ― I know that firsthand ― and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own. Just remember, as Dave Liniger once said, "You can't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork." (Laughter) 	<br><br>

Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
Too often, people feel checked out of politics ― even at the level of their own city. But urban activist Alessandra Orofino thinks that can change, using a mix of tech and old-fashioned human connection. Sharing examples from her hometown of Rio, she says: "It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots, recycling projects or construction sites, cars or buses, loneliness or solidarity." 	<br><br>

Fifty-four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries, one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities, and 80 percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems, like climate change, the energy crisis or poverty, are really, in many ways, city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities, like most of us, actually start doing a better job, because right now, we are not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life: first, our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions; second, our cities' ability to really include all of their residents; and lastly, our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:37	<br><br>
	
When it comes to engagement, the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '80s, and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before, and if those numbers are bad at the national level, at the level of our cities, they are just dismal. In the last two years, two of the world's most consolidated, oldest democracies, the U.S. and France, held nationwide municipal elections. In France, voter turnout hit a record low. Almost 40 percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities, voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which 95 percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A., a city of four million people, elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in 100 years. Right here, in my city of Rio, in spite of mandatory voting, almost 30 percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:17	<br><br>
	
When it comes to inclusiveness, our cities are not the best cases of success either, and again, you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alemao. This is where over 70,000 of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index, of .967. That is higher than Norway, Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alemao has an HDI of .711. It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio, like so many cities across the global South, is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa in the space of 30 minutes. If you drive, that is. If you take public transit, it's about two hours. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:27	<br><br>
	
And lastly, perhaps most importantly, cities, with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable, could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead, countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades, and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many, many American cities, and as a result, they have seen a decline of relations, of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity, honesty, and social and civic participation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:37	<br><br>
	
So how do we start building cities that make us care? Cities that value their most important asset: the incredible diversity of the people who live in them? Cities that make us happy? Well, I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like, then we really have to change the decision-making processes that have given us the results that we have right now. We need a participation revolution, and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June 2013 have taught us anything, it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context, we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change, because when it does, not only will people re-engage with the structures of representation, but also complement these structures with direct, effective, and collective decision making, decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature, decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
But there is a catch, obviously: Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare, and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role, by making it easier for people to organize, communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:57	<br><br>
	
Unfortunately for us, when it comes to fostering democratic processes, our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far, most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city: potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also, to a lesser extent, invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them, just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice: I had to be in bed by 8 p.m., but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation, and in fact, governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters ― the way we allocate our budget, the way we occupy our land, and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:11	<br><br>
	
The good news is, and I do have good news to share with you, we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago, I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio, and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city, and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years, Meu Rio grew to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio. About 40 percent of those members are young people aged 20 to 29. That is one in every 15 young people of that age in Rio today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:11	<br><br>
	
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl, Bia, to your right, and Bia was just 11 years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country, and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build, I kid you not, a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign, and we even watched her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring, and many months afterwards, the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:55	<br><br>
	
There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about 10 years ago, and since then, she has been looking for her daughter. In that process, she found out that first, she was not alone. In the last year alone, 2013, 6,000 people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that, Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities, those systems have helped solve up to 80 percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign, and after the secretary of security got 16,000 emails from people asking him to do this, he responded, and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month, and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:56	<br><br>
	
And then, there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio, and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year, December 16, he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer, who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools, the Pressure Cooker, the same one that Bia and Jovita used, and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:38	<br><br>
	
These stories make me happy, but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low-income communities in Rio, and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia, Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know: We are ready. As citizens, we are ready to decide on our common destinies, because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone, and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another, and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network, the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in Sao Paulo with incredible results, and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen-centric, citizen-led organizations that can inspire us, challenge us, and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots, community-driven recycling projects or construction sites, loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses, and it is our responsibility to do that now, for ourselves, for our families, for the people who make our lives worth living, and for the incredible creativity, beauty, and wonder that make our cities, in spite of all of their problems, the greatest invention of our time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:06	<br><br>
	
Obrigado. Thank you. 	<br><br>

世界上54%的人口 居住在城市。 在发展中国家， 有三分之一的人 居住在贫民窟。 全球75%的能源消耗 发生在城市， 导致全球变暖的气体排放有80% 是来自城市。 那些你和我可能认为 是全球性的问题， 比如气候变化、能源危机 或者贫穷， 事实上从很多方面来讲，是城市问题。 这些问题是不会得到解决的，除非 居住在城市里的人们―― 就像我们在座的大多数―― 真正行动起来， 因为现在我们做的还很不够。 当我们从以下三个方面考察城市生活时， 这一点就变得非常清楚了。 首先是我们的公民参与民主制度的意愿； 其次是我们的城市能够真正包容 它所有的居民的能力； 最后是我们自己 能够充实而快乐地生活的能力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:37	<br><br>
	
谈到民主参与意愿， 我们有很清楚的数据。 全世界的选民投票率 在上世纪80年代达到峰值， 然后以一个前所未有的速度在下降， 如果说这些数字在国家层面已经很坏了， 那么在城市层面 则更惨淡了。 在过去两年中， 世界上最坚固、 最老牌的两个民主国家，美国和法国 都举行了全国性的市政府选举。 在法国，投票率再创新低。 将近40%的选民决定 不去投票。 在美国，这个数字更加可怕。 在某些美国城市， 投票率仅仅接近5%。 我会给大家一点时间消化。 我们正在谈论的是那些民主城市， 而在这些地方，有95%的民众 觉得选举他们的领导人并不是一件重要的事情。 洛杉矶，这座拥有400万居民的城市， 仅仅用20万多一点的选票就选出了市长。 这是这座城市近100年来投票率最低的一次选举。 在这里，我所居住的城市里约， 尽管强制要求民众投票， 还是有将近30%的选民 决定将他们的选票作废 或者待在家里并支付罚款， 就在上一次的市长选举中。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:17	<br><br>
	
谈到包容性， 我们的城市也做得不是很成功， 跟前面一样，你不需要很费力 就可以看到这样的证据。 里约是一个非常不平等的城市。 这是莱布朗区， 莱布朗是这座城市最富裕的社区。 而这里是阿莱芒贫民窟， 容纳了7万多这座城市 最贫穷的人。 莱布朗区的HDI，人类发展指数 是0.967。 这比挪威、瑞士或者瑞典的都要高。 而阿莱芒的人类发展指数是0.711， 介于阿尔及利亚和加蓬之间。 就像南半球的许多其它城市一样，里约 是一个你可以 在30分钟内经历 从北欧到撒哈拉以南的非洲的地方―― 当然前提是你自己开车。 如果你乘坐公共交通，那就需要2个小时。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:27	<br><br>
	
最后一点，也可能是最重要的一点， 城市，因其产生的令人难以置信的 人际关系方面的财富， 可以是人类幸福蓬勃发展的理想场所。 我们喜欢待在人群之中。 我们是群居动物。 然而，那些城镇化已经达到峰值的国家 似乎也正是那些城市不再使人们快乐的国家。 美国人 在过去三十年总体幸福度是在下降的， 主要原因就在此。 美国人建设城市的方式 导致许多高质量的公共空间 在许多美国城市几乎消失殆尽， 结果，我们看到的是 人际关系的衰退 以及那些使我们快乐的东西的衰退。 很多研究都表明 有越来越多的孤独， 而团结、诚信，社会与公民参与却越来越少。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:37	<br><br>
	
我们要如何开始建造我们自己在乎的城市？ 这个城市重视其最重要的资产： 即居住在其中的人们所呈现的惊人的多样性。 我们要如何建造能使我们快乐的城市？ 我认为如果我们想要改变 我们城市的现状， 那么我们必须得去改变 那些让我们之所以有现在这样的城市的决策程序。 我们需要一个参与革命， 并且越快越好。 那种把投票作为我们唯一的履行公民权的想法 已经不再有意义了。 人们已经厌倦了仅仅是 在每隔几年需要将权力 授予某人时 才被当作有能力的个体对待。 如果说2013年6月横扫整个巴西的游行示威 告诉了我们什么的话， 那就是每一次当我们尝试着 在选举以外行使我们的权力时， 我们只会挨打、受辱或被捕。 这种情况需要改变， 因为改变之后， 人们不仅会重新参与到 代表结构中来， 而且还可以用 直接、高效和集体的决策来补充这些结构， 那种通过它本身包容的本质来攻击不平等的决策， 那种可以使我们的城市变得更宜居的决策。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
但很明显，问题没那么简单。 促成广泛的民众参与 和权力再分配 实际操作起来会是一个噩梦， 而这也是科技能够充当 一个非常有用的角色的地方―― 它可以使人们更容易地组织、 交流和决策， 而且大家不必在同一时间出现在同一地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:57	<br><br>
	
对我们来说不幸的是， 在促进民主的过程中， 我们的政府并没有让科技 发挥它的全部潜能。 目前为止，大部分的市政府 在使用科技将公民变成人体传感器方面非常有效， 公民给当局报告一些城市数据： 比如哪里出现了坑洼、 哪里的树倒了或者哪里的灯坏了等等。 这些城市政府还会在小范围内 邀请民众参与到改善 决策结果的活动中来， 事实上这些决策是早已为这些民众做好了的， 这情形就跟在我八岁的时候 妈妈告诉我可以自己做选择一样： 我必须得在晚上八点钟前上床， 但是我可以选择穿粉红色或者蓝色的睡衣。 那不是参与， 事实上，政府还不善于 使用科技让民众参与到 那些重要的事情中来―― 比如我们分配预算的方式， 我们使用土地的方式， 以及我们管理我们的自然资源的方式。 这些都是能够真正影响那些 在我们的城市出现的全球问题的决策。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:11	<br><br>
	
好消息是， 我真的有一个好消息要分享给你们， 那就是我们不需要等到政府去做这些。 我有理由相信 公民可以构建 属于他们自己的参与结构。 3年前，我跟别人一起成立了一个组织， 叫做“我的里约”， 我们使里约的居民能够更容易地 围绕他们所在城市里的那些他们关心的 事件和地点去组织活动， 并且每天对这些事件和地点产生影响。 在过去的三年里，“我的里约”已经成长为 一个覆盖十六万里约市民的网络。 这些人中有40%是 20到29岁的年轻人， 也就是今天的里约这个年龄段的 每15个年轻人中就有一个是“我的里约”的成员。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:11	<br><br>
	
这个可爱的小姑娘也是我们的成员之一， 她叫比亚，在你的右边， 她当时只有11岁， 比亚使用我们的一个工具发起了一场 保卫她的学校免被拆除的运动。 事实上她的学校跻身于 这个国家最好的公立学校之列， 然而里约热内卢州政府打算把它拆了 去建――我不跟你开玩笑―― 去建一个为世界杯服务的停车场， 就在这场盛事开始前。 比亚发起了一场运动，我们甚至通过 网络摄像监控24小时不间断观察她的学校， 几个月后， 政府改变了主意。 比亚的学校得以保全。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:55	<br><br>
	
还有约维塔的故事。 她是一个了不起的女人，她女儿 10年前走丢了， 从那以后，她就一直在寻找她的女儿。 在这个过程中，她第一次发现 她并不是唯一的一个。 仅去年，也就是2013年， 里约州就有6000人失踪。 但她也发现尽管如此， 里约却没有一个处理失踪案件的集中的情报系统。 在其它的巴西城市，这样的系统 已经帮助处理了高达80%的 失踪案件。 她发起了一场运动， 在安全部长收到了16000封 要求他建立这样的系统的邮件后， 他做出了回应，并开始建造一支 专门处理这些案件的警察队伍。 上个月底它已经对公众开放了， 约维塔也在场 并且很高兴地接受了采访。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:56	<br><br>
	
接下来，我要说说莱安德罗的故事。 莱安德罗是一个 居住在里约一个贫民窟的了不起的家伙， 他在那个贫民窟创建了一个资源回收项目。 去年年底，12月16日， 他收到了里约热内卢州政府的驱逐令， 他们给了他两周的时间搬离 他已经使用了两年的地方。 他们的计划是这块地交给一个开发商， 这个开发商则打算将它变成一个建筑工地。 莱安德罗发起了一场运动，他使用了我们的一个工具， 叫做“高压锅”， 这也是比亚和约维塔曾经使用过的， 然后州政府在圣诞前夕改变了主意。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:38	<br><br>
	
这些故事让我很开心， 但不仅仅是因为它们有一个美满的结局。 它们让我开心是因为它们 是一个愉快的开始。 比亚学校里的老师和学生家长 正在寻找其他能进一步 改善这个空间的方法。 莱安德罗有着雄心勃勃的计划， 他计划将他的模式带到里约的其它低收入社区， 而约维塔正在她帮助创建的 那个警队做义工。 比亚、约维塔和莱安德罗 是这样的活生生的例子， 这是全世界的公民和城市政府都 需要知道的，也就是： 我们准备好了。 作为公民，我们准备好了 去决定我们共同的命运， 因为我们知道我们分配权力的方式 说明我们是如何真正重视每一个人的， 因为我们知道 支持和参与当地政治 是我们真正关心 我们彼此的关系的一个标志， 并且我们已经准备好了 现在就开始在全世界的城市里行动起来。 通过“我们的城市”网络， “我的里约”团队 希望跟其他想要在他们自己的城市 创建类似项目的人分享我们学到的东西。 我们已经开始在圣保罗这样做了， 并且取得了令人难以置信的成果， 我们想要将它带到世界各地的城市―― 通过一个以公民为中心的、 公民主导的组织的网络， 而这些组织可以激励我们、 挑战我们并提醒我们去 真正参与到我们城市生活中来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
最终的决定权在我们手里， 我们是想要学校 还是停车场， 社区回收项目 还是建筑工地， 孤独或团结，汽车或公交， 现在我们有责任去做这些， 为我们自己，为我们的家人， 也为那些让我们值得生活下去的人们， 以及为那惊人的创造力、美丽和奇迹―― 那些使得我们的城市成为―― 尽管它们有着各种各样的问题―― 我们这个时代最伟大的发明的东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:06	<br><br>
	
谢谢，感谢你们。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">What new power looks like</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
We can see the power of distributed, crowd-sourced business models every day ― witness Uber, Kickstarter, Airbnb. But veteran online activist Jeremy Heimans asks: When does that kind of "new power" start to work in politics? His surprising answer: Sooner than you think. It’s a bold argument about the future of politics and power; watch and see if you agree. 	<br><br>

So this is Anna Hazare, and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge digital activist in the world today. And you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian anticorruption and social justice activist. And in 2011, he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India, a topic that Indian elites love to ignore. So as part of this campaign, he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good Gandhian organizer would use. So he was on a hunger strike, and Hazare realized through his hunger that actually maybe this time, in the 21st century, a hunger strike wouldn't be enough. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:53	<br><br>
	
So he started playing around with mobile activism. So the first thing he did is he said to people, "Okay, why don't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption?" So he does this, he gives people a short code, and about 80,000 people do it. Okay, that's pretty respectable. But then he decides, "Let me tweak my tactics a little bit." He says, "Why don't you leave me a missed call?" Now, for those of you who have lived in the global South, you'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture. I see people nodding. People leave missed calls all the time: If you're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you're on the way, you leave them a missed call. If you're dating someone and you just want to say "I miss you" you leave them a missed call. So a note for a dating tip here, in some cultures, if you want to please your lover, you call them and hang up. (Laughter) So why do people leave missed calls? Well, the reason of course is that they're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
So when Hazare asked people to leave him a missed call, let's have a little guess how many people actually did this? Thirty-five million. So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history. It's remarkable. And this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging Indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring. But he used that, Hazare ended up with this massive CSV file of mobile phone numbers, and he used that to deploy real people power on the ground to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi to make a national point of everyday corruption in India. It's a really striking story. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
So this is me when I was 12 years old. I hope you see the resemblance. And I was also an activist, and I have been an activist all my life. I had this really funny childhood where I traipsed around the world meeting world leaders and Noble prize winners, talking about Third World debt, as it was then called, and demilitarization. I was a very, very serious child. (Laughter) And back then, in the early '90s, I had a very cutting-edge tech tool of my own: the fax. And the fax was the tool of my activism. And at that time, it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people all at once. I'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran. It was the eve of the Gulf War and I organized a global campaign to flood the hotel, the Intercontinental in Geneva, where James Baker and Tariq Aziz were meeting on the eve of the war, and I thought if I could flood them with faxes, we'll stop the war. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
Well, unsurprisingly, that campaign was wholly unsuccessful. There are lots of reasons for that, but there's no doubt that one sputtering fax machine in Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint in terms of the ability to get a message to lots of people. And so, I went on to discover some better tools. I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the Internet to mobilize people and now has almost 40 million members, and I now run Purpose, which is a home for these kinds of technology-powered movements. So what's the moral of this story? Is the moral of this story, you know what, the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone? This is another story of tech-determinism? Well, I would argue that there's actually more to it than that. I'd argue that in the last 20 years, something more fundamental has changed than just new tech. I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:42	<br><br>
	
You ask any activist how to understand the world, and they'll say, "Look at where the power is, who has it, how it's shifting." And I think we all sense that something big is happening. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
So Henry Timms and I ― Henry's a fellow movement builder ― got talking one day and we started to think, how can we make sense of this new world? How can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful? Because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society. So I want to introduce you to this framework: Old power, meet new power. And I want to talk to you about what new power is today. New power is the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination ― these are the two key elements ― to create change and shift outcomes. And we see new power all around us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
This is Beppe Grillo he was a populist Italian blogger who, with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools, won more than 25 percent of the vote in recent Italian elections. This is Airbnb, which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate. This is Kickstarter, which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people. Now, we're familiar with all of these models. But what's striking is the commonalities, the structural features of these new models and how they differ from old power. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:08	<br><br>
	
Let's look a little bit at this. Old power is held like a currency. New power works like a current. Old power is held by a few. New power isn't held by a few, it's made by many. Old power is all about download, and new power uploads. And you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace, whether it's in media or politics or education. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:31	<br><br>
	
So we've talked a little bit about what new power is. Let's, for a second, talk about what new power isn't. New power is not your Facebook page. I assure you that having a social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio. Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, I assure you that his Facebook page has not embraced the power of participation. New power is not inherently positive. In fact, this isn't an normative argument that we're making, there are many good things about new power, but it can produce bad outcomes. More participation, more peer coordination, sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things, like things, for example, in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near. And thirdly, new power is not the inevitable victor. In fact, unsurprisingly, as many of these new power models get to scale, what you see is this massive pushback from the forces of old power. Just look at this really interesting epic struggle going on right now between Edward Snowden and the NSA. You'll note that only one of the two people on this slide is currently in exile. And so, it's not at all clear that new power will be the inevitable victor. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:43	<br><br>
	
That said, keep one thing in mind: We're at the beginning of a very steep curve. So you think about some of these new power models, right? These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago, and now they're disrupting entire industries. And so, what's interesting about new power, is the way it feeds on itself. Once you have an experience of new power, you tend to expect and want more of it. So let's say you've used a peer-to-peer lending platform like Lending Tree or Prosper, then you've figured out that you don't need the bank, and who wants the bank, right? And so, that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life. And what this gives rise to is a set of values. We talked about the models that new power has engendered ― the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters. What about the values? And this is an early sketch at what new power values look like. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:38	<br><br>
	
New power values prize transparency above all else. It's almost a religious belief in transparency, a belief that if you shine a light on something, it will be better. And remember that in the 20th century, this was not at all true. People thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements. New power values of informal, networked governance. New power folks would never have invented the U.N. today, for better or worse. New power values participation, and new power is all about do-it-yourself. In fact, what's interesting about new power is that it eschews some of the professionalization and specialization that was all the rage in the 20th century. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
9:17	<br><br>
	
So what's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations. So we've spent a bit of time thinking, how can we plot organizations on a two-by-two where, essentially, we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit? We started with a U.S. analysis, and let me show you some interesting findings. So the first is Apple. In this framework, we actually described Apple as an old power company. That's because the ideology, the governing ideology of Apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in Cupertino. It's absolutely about that beautiful, perfect thing descending upon us in perfection. And it does not value, as a company, transparency. In fact, it's very secretive. Now, Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world. So this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy. But one can argue that there's real vulnerabilites in that model. I think another interesting comparison is that of the Obama campaign versus the Obama presidency. (Applause) Now, I like President Obama, but he ran with new power at his back, right? And he said to people, we are the ones we've been waiting for. And he used crowdfunding to power a campaign. But when he got into office, he governed like more or less all the other presidents did. And this is a really interesting trend, is when new power gets powerful, what happens? So this is a framework you should look at and think about where your own organization sits on it. And think about where it should be in five or 10 years. So what do you do if you're old power? Well, if you're there thinking, in old power, this won't happen to us. Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopadia Britannica. Let me tell you, it's a very sad read. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
11:14	<br><br>
	
But if you are old power, the most important thing you can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you, before you are occupied. Imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization. And ask them, would they like what they see and should our model change? What about if you're new power? Is new power kind of just riding the wave to glory? I would argue no. I would argue that there are some very real challenges to new power in this nascent phase. Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment. Occupy was this incredible example of new power, the purest example of new power. And yet, it failed to consolidate. So the energy that it created was great for the meme phase, but they were so committed to participation, that they never got anything done. And in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is: how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:16	<br><br>
	
One the other end of the spectra is Uber. Uber is an amazing, highly scalable new power model. That network is getting denser and denser by the day. But what's really interesting about Uber is it hasn't really adopted new power values. This is a real quote from the Uber CEO recently: He says, "Once we get rid of the dude in the car" ― he means drivers ― "Uber will be cheaper." Now, new power models live and die by the strength of their networks. By whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it. Because they're not an exercise of top-down perfectionism, they are about the network. And so, the challenge, and this is why it's in no way surprising, is that Uber's drivers are now unionizing. It's extraordinary. Uber's drivers are turning on Uber. And the challenge for Uber ― this isn't an easy situation for them ― is that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture that is really old power. They've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets. Those markets expect a financial return, and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your users and your drivers for more and more value and giving that value to your investors. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
13:34	<br><br>
	
So the big question about the future of new power, in my view, is: Will that old power just emerge? So will new power elites just become old power and squeeze? Or will that new power base bite back? Will the next big Uber be co-owned by Uber drivers? And I think this going to be a very interesting structural question. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:56	<br><br>
	
Finally, think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly better consumer experiences. My call to action for new power is to not be an island. We have major structural problems in the world today that could benefit enormously from the kinds of mass participation and peer coordination that these new power players know so well how to generate. And we badly need them to turn their energies and their power to big, what economists might call public goods problems, that are often beyond markets where investors can easily be found. And I think if we can do that, we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings' sense of their own agency and power ― because I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power, is that people feel more powerful ― but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to authority and institutions. And to me, that's absolutely worth trying for. Thank you very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>

这是安纳 哈扎尔， 哈扎尔或许是当今世界上走在最前沿的 线上行动主义者。 从外表是看不出来的。 印度人哈扎尔现已77岁， 是致力于反腐和司法公正的积极分子。 在2011年，他发动了一场宏大的运动， 挑战印度的日常腐败作风， 这是印度精英阶层长期有意忽视的问题。 作为这场运动的一部分， 他采取了任何一位甘地式运动组织者 都会运用的策略， 即进行绝食抗议， 绝食经历让哈扎尔意识到， 在二十一世纪的今天， 绝食抗议 或许无法实现全部的目的。 他进而尝试借助手机开展运动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:57	<br><br>
	
他做的第一件事是号召民众， 「如果你们支持我的反腐运动， 为什么不发给我 一条短信呢？」 因此他这样做了，他给人们一个短码， 大约有8万人响应号召。 这的确令人敬畏。 他因而决定， 「我要更进一步。」 他鼓动民众， 「你们为何不给我留一个未接来电呢？」 如果你生活在南半球， 那就会知道未接来电 已成为世界手机文化的重要组成部分， 我看到有人点头了。 人们时时刻刻都在利用未接来电： 如果你要参加一场会议， 眼看着就要迟到了， 想让他们知道你在路上， 给他们一个未接来电就好了。 如果你在跟某人谈恋爱， 想表达一下思念之情， 震他（她）手机一下就好了。 在某些文化中， 这是个约会小技巧， 如果你想取悦另一半， 拨通号码，立即挂掉。 （笑声） 话说回来，人们为什么会利用未接来电？ 原因当然是 省去打电话或发短信的费用。 因此， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
当哈扎尔号召民众为他留一个未接来电时 我们猜一下，有多少人响应号召？ 三千五百万人 这是人类历史上参与人数最多的运动之一。 很了不起。 蓬勃发展的印度中产阶级由此 展现了其无比雄厚的实力， 也展现了利用手机所能积聚的力量。 哈扎尔采用这种方法， 最终得到了存储大量 电话号码的CSV文件。 他利用这个方法， 汇聚众人的力量， 成千上万的民众走向新德里街头， 举国上下因此对日常腐败恶习投以关注。 这真是个振奋人心的故事。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
这是12岁的我， 希望你们能看出些相似之处。 我也是个行动主义者， 从小到大，这一点未曾改变过。 我的童年过得相当有趣， 周游各国， 与全球领导者和诺贝尔奖获得者 当面讨论第三世界债务问题， 后来这个问题演变为 非军事化问题。 自小我就忧国忧民。 （笑声） 后来， 在90年代初期， 我拥有了最先进的武器， 传真。 传真是我践行行动主义的工具。 那时， 一次性将信息传达给众人 传真无疑是最好的办法。 我给你们举个例子吧 在海湾战争前夕， 我组织了一起运动， 号召民众「淹没」， 日内瓦的洲际酒店， 詹姆斯 贝克与塔里克 阿齐兹 将于战前在此会晤， 我当时想，如果我能用传真号召民众， 「淹没酒店」， 就能阻止这场战争了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
然而，不出所料， 这场运动彻彻底底地失败了。 失败的原因很多， 但毫无疑问的是， 当时在日内瓦， 传真机受宽带限制， 无法有效地将信息传递给大量民众。 因此，我开始寻找更好的工具。 其后我与他人共同成立了Avaaz， 利用互联网来号召民众， 目前约有4千万名成员， 如今我在运营Purpose， Purpose孕育了那些借助技术力量的运动。 这个故事的寓意是什么？ 我讲这个故事是为了说明 传真逐步被手机取代这一事实吗？ 又是一个技术决定论的故事吗？ 我想说，其寓意远不止于此。 我敢断言，在过去的20年里， 一些事情发生了根本性的改变， 而不仅是新技术。 我敢断言， 势力的平衡点在世界范围内 从根本上发生了转变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:42	<br><br>
	
你问任何一位行动主义者， 如何看清世界的局势？ 他会说， 「看看势力集中在何处， 谁拥有势力，势力如何转移。」 我认为，我们都能感觉到， 世界在发生某种巨大的改变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
因此，某一天，在亨利 蒂姆斯 ――我开展运动的一位同伴―― 与我聊天的时候， 我们想到， 如何理解这个新世界？ 如何描述这个世界？ 新世界的格局是什么？ 如何在这个格局下有所作为？ 因为我们意识到， 我们在运动中习得的经验教训， 适用于全世界范围内的 社会的方方面面。 因此我想向你们介绍这个格局： 新旧势力的相遇。 我想跟你们谈谈如今的新兴势力。 新势力的发展基于 大众参与和对等协调 这两个关键因素， 新势力促进变革，影响结果的走向。 新势力无处不在。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
这是贝佩 格里洛， 一位意大利博主，宣扬平民主义， 他只有最有限的政治工具， 却凭借网络手段， 在最近意大利的选举中 赢得了超过25%的选票。 这是Airbnb， 旗下不曾拥有任何房产， 却在短短几年内， 震撼了整个酒店行业。 这是 Kickstarter， 从五百多万人手里 筹集到十亿多美金。 我们对这些运营模式耳熟能详， 引入注目的地方在于这些模式的共性， 它们的结构特点， 以及跟旧势力与众不同的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:08	<br><br>
	
让我们进一步看这个问题。 旧势力运作如同货币流通， 新势力运作如同波涛涌动。 旧势力掌握在少数人手里， 新势力并非如此，而是分散在众多人手中。 旧势力完完全全是自上而下， 而新势力是自下而上。 你看到新势力所有的特征 都是有迹可寻的， 无论是在媒体，政治还是教育领域。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:31	<br><br>
	
好，我们刚才谈了谈新势力是什么， 现在，我们花点时间聊聊新势力不是什么。 新势力不是你的Facebook主页。 我向你保证，你采用的社交媒体战略， 是自上而下的， 你的所获所得， 跟过去用广播的策略没什么两样。 问一下叙利亚独裁者巴沙尔 阿萨德吧， 我向你保证，他的Facebook主页 并没有实现势力的共同参与。 新势力并非是固有的正面力量。 事实上，我们所做的并不是一种规范性论证。 新势力有其积极的一面， 但也会带来负面影响。 更广泛的参与，更深入的对等协调， 有时会带来意想不到的结果。 有一些事情， 比如，新势力涉足医疗领域， 这绝不是我们希望看到的。 第三，新势力不是永远的赢家， 事实上，不出所料的是， 随着诸多新势力影响力逐步扩大， 来自旧势力的阻力 越发强大 就看一下仍在持续的 爱德华 斯诺登和美国国家安全局 之间的恩恩怨怨吧--- 一个有趣的、史诗性的对决。 你要注意的是， 两方中只有一方 远走他乡，寻求避难。 因此，新势力是永远的赢家的说法 根本站不住脚。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:43	<br><br>
	
这就意味着，有句话你要记在心里： 我们正处在这个陡峭的曲线的起点。 你在考虑某些新势力的模式，没错吧？ 这些模式在几年前还是某些人 在车库里的灵感， 如今正颠覆着整个行业。 因此，新势力有趣之处在于 其自我发展的方式。 一旦你体验过新势力， 你就会期望享受更多。 打个比方，你使用过Lending Tree或Prosper 对等借贷平台， 你会发现你不需要银行了， 谁还想用银行服务呢？ 因此，这种体验会促使你， 让你希望这种体验能 融入生活的其他方面。 一系列价值观 因此而产生 我们讨论了新势力 造就的模式―― 如Airbnbs，Kickstarters。 价值观呢？ 这是对新势力 价值观的初步认识 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
信息透明是最重要的价值观。 新势力对信息透明 秉持着几近虔诚的信仰。 给它一束光， 它就绽放。 要知道，在20世纪时， 这并不是完全能实现的。 过去，人们认为绅士们应紧闭大门， 暗中达成彼此都满意的协议。 新势力看重的是非正式的、网络化管理。 今天，新势力时代的人 永远不会建立什么联合国， 连边都沾不上。 新势力重视参与度， 新势力完全是自己动手做事。 事实上，新势力有趣的地方在于， 它在一定程度上避免了 20世纪时风行 的职业化和专业化 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:17	<br><br>
	
这些新势力模式和价值观 有趣之处就在于 它们对于组织的意义。 我们已花了些时间考虑 该如何在二维坐标上 标明各组织所处的位置， 在这个坐标上， 我们能看到新势力价值观和模式， 并能看到不同人所处的位置。 我们以发生在美国的例子做分析， 我给你们展示一些有趣的发现。 首先是苹果公司， 在这个坐标上，我们事实上将苹果公司 定位于旧势力公司。 原因是其企业意识形态， 在苹果公司，盛行的是 库比蒂诺完美主义 产品设计师的意识形态。 这完全是经典无暇的产品 完美地闯入我们的世界。 而且苹果公司并没有信息透明的价值观。 事实上，苹果公司很重视信息保密。 如今，苹果公司是世界上最成功的公司之一。 这意味着， 你仍然可以成功追求旧势力策略。 有人会说，这个模式有其脆弱的一面。 我想，还有另一个有趣的例子， 即奥巴马竞选 与奥巴马执政的对比 （掌声） 我喜欢奥巴马总统， 但他总在暗中行使新势力，没错吧？ 他曾对我们说， 我们在等的那个人就是我们自己。 他采用群众募资的方式 来壮大运动 但当他登台后， 他的表现就或多或少 与其他总统别无二致了。 这真是个有趣的趋势， 当新势力变得强大后， 会发生什么？ 因此，你应当考虑一下 你的组织在这个坐标上 所处的位置 并考虑一下五年或十年后 你期望它所处的位置。 如果你的组织是旧势力，该怎么做？ 假设你身为旧势力， 如果你这么想， 这不会发生在我们身上 那么就在维基百科上搜一下 大英百科全书这个词条吧。 我来告诉你， 这个词条的内容会让人感到伤感 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:14	<br><br>
	
如果你的组织是旧势力， 对你而言最重要的就是 在别人占领你的地盘前， 牢牢守好自己的地盘。 设想一下，让最质疑你的组织的一群人 驻扎在你的组织核心之处， 提出最尖锐的问题， 而且他们可以看到你的组织中的一切。 随后问问他们是否喜欢眼前的事实， 你的模式需不需要做出改变？ 如果你的组织是新势力，该做些什么？ 新势力就会一帆风顺，直奔光明吗？ 我会说，不是的。 我认为，现实中，在新势力初期阶段 存在一些真正的挑战。 让我们花些时间关注在「占领华尔街」运动上。 这个运动是经典的新势力的例子， 且极具代表性。 然而，其成果没能得到巩固， 因此，该运动所激发出的能量， 对最初的模仿阶段来说 是难能可贵的。 但他们太过专注于参与度， 而没有将任何事情落于实处。 事实上，这个模式意味着， 对新势力的挑战在于： 在未制度化的前提下， 如何发挥制度的优势？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:16	<br><br>
	
坐标轴另一端的例子是Uber。 Uber很不可思议， 拥有强大的新势力模式， 且影响范围极易扩张， 网络覆盖率变得越来越密集 但Uber真正有趣的地方在于 它并没有秉持新势力价值观。 下面这句话引自Uber的首席执行官， 「一旦我们摆脱出租车里的这位老兄」 ――他指司机―― 「Uber就会便宜了。」 如今，这些新势力模式生死取决于 关系网络是否强大， 也取决于司机和消费者 ――这些接受这项服务的人――是否相信它。 因为它们并不是自上而下的完美主义成果， 而是关于关系网络的。 因此，这个挑战， 这就是为什么Uber的司机 正着手成立工会， 这真的一点儿都不让人感觉奇怪 这真的不同寻常 Uber的司机正在对抗Uber， Uber面临的挑战―― 对他们而言不是好形势―― 是他们已被困在更宽泛的上层结构中， 而这无疑是旧势力。 他们已在资本市场募集超过十亿美金， 市场期望获得经济回报， 而获得经济回报的方式， 就是不断不断地压榨 你的用户和司机， 获取更多的利润， 转移到投资者手中。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:34	<br><br>
	
未来新势力的关键问题， 在我看来，即： 旧势力会出现吗？ 新势力的精英们 会变为旧势力，并压榨他人吗？ 或者，新势力的基础会走回头路吗？ 下一个Uber 会由Uber的司机共同拥有吗？ 我认为，这会是一个很有趣的 结构层面上的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:56	<br><br>
	
最后，新势力不只是 扩大事物的影响范围 让我们 拥有了更好的用户体验。 我对于新势力的呼吁是， 不要孤立。 今天我们面临严重的结构性问题， 我们能从广泛参与和对等协调中 获益良多， 而广泛参与和对等协调对于 这些新势力的弄潮者来说 可谓轻车熟路。 我们急需他们将能量和势力 转移到这些严重的问题上， 经济学家或许会称其为公共财产问题， 这些问题通常远在市场之外， 投资者不会轻易发现。 我认为，如果我们能做到这一点， 我们或许不仅能从根本上改变 人们对于其自身能力的看法―― 因为，我认为这是对于 新势力而言最美好的事情， 即人们感觉自身势力更强大―― 或许还能改变 我们与他人之间相处的方式， 与权贵和机构来往的方式。 对于我而言， 这完全值得努力去争取。 非常感谢你们。 （掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">What do we do with all this big data?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Does a set of data make you feel more comfortable? More successful? Then your interpretation of it is likely wrong. In a surprisingly moving talk, Susan Etlinger explains why, as we receive more and more data, we need to deepen our critical thinking skills. Because it's hard to move beyond counting things to really understanding them. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
Technology has brought us so much: the moon landing, the Internet, the ability to sequence the human genome. But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears, and about 30 years ago, the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called "Amusing Ourselves to Death," which lays this out really brilliantly. And here's what he said, comparing the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. He said, Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture. Orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us, and Huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. In a nutshell, it's a choice between Big Brother watching you and you watching Big Brother. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:07	<br><br>
	
But it doesn't have to be this way. We are not passive consumers of data and technology. We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it, but to do that, we have to pay as much attention to how we think as how we code. We have to ask questions, and hard questions, to move past counting things to understanding them. We're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world, but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it, size isn't everything. There's also the speed at which it moves, and the many varieties of data types, and here are just a few examples: images, text, video, audio. And what unites this disparate types of data is that they're created by people and they require context. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
Now, there's a group of data scientists out of the University of Illinois-Chicago, and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory, and they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking, how they talk about electronic cigarettes, and what they can do collectively to help them quit. The interesting thing is, if you want to understand how people talk about smoking, first you have to understand what they mean when they say "smoking." And on Twitter, there are four main categories: number one, smoking cigarettes; number two, smoking marijuana; number three, smoking ribs; and number four, smoking hot women. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:57	<br><br>
	
So then you have to think about, well, how do people talk about electronic cigarettes? And there are so many different ways that people do this, and you can see from the slide it's a complex kind of a query. And what it reminds us is that language is created by people, and people are messy and we're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this 24/7 in many, many languages, and then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
So did these ads that the CDC put on, these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing, did they actually have an impact on whether people quit? And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data, but they were able to conclude that those advertisements ― and you may have seen them ― that they had the effect of jolting people into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior. And what I admire and appreciate about this project, aside from the fact, including the fact that it's based on real human need, is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
And so it's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation, because let's face it, we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data, no matter how small, and screwing it up. So many years ago, you may remember that former President Ronald Reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things. And it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair. He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials that facts are stubborn things. But I actually think there's a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said, because facts are stubborn things, but sometimes they're stupid, too. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:02	<br><br>
	
I want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me. I need to take a breath. My son Isaac, when he was two, was diagnosed with autism, and he was this happy, hilarious, loving, affectionate little guy, but the metrics on his developmental evaluations, which looked at things like the number of words ― at that point, none ― communicative gestures and minimal eye contact, put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby. And the diagnosis was factually correct, but it didn't tell the whole story. And about a year and a half later, when he was almost four, I found him in front of the computer one day running a Google image search on women, spelled "w-i-m-e-n." And I did what any obsessed parent would do, which is immediately started hitting the "back" button to see what else he'd been searching for. And they were, in order: men, school, bus and computer. And I was stunned, because we didn't know that he could spell, much less read, and so I asked him, "Isaac, how did you do this?" And he looked at me very seriously and said, "Typed in the box." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
He was teaching himself to communicate, but we were looking in the wrong place, and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric ― in this case, verbal communication ― and undervalue others, such as creative problem-solving. Communication was hard for Isaac, and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know. And when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense, because forming a question is a really complex process, but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:10	<br><br>
	
And so this little moment had a really profound impact on me and our family because it helped us change our frame of reference for what was going on with him, and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
Facts are stupid things. And they're vulnerable to misuse, willful or otherwise. I have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist, and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago entitled "The 10 Weirdest Things Ever Linked to Autism." It's quite a list. The Internet, blamed for everything, right? And of course mothers, because. And actually, wait, there's more, there's a whole bunch in the "mother" category here. And you can see it's a pretty rich and interesting list. I'm a big fan of being pregnant near freeways, personally. The final one is interesting, because the term "refrigerator mother" was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism, and that meant somebody who was cold and unloving. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:22	<br><br>
	
And at this point, you might be thinking, "Okay, Susan, we get it, you can take data, you can make it mean anything." And this is true, it's absolutely true, but the challenge is that we have this opportunity to try to make meaning out of it ourselves, because frankly, data doesn't create meaning. We do. So as businesspeople, as consumers, as patients, as citizens, we have a responsibility, I think, to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills. Why? Because at this point in our history, as we've heard many times over, we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed, and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly, efficiently, and with far greater impact than we did in the past. Great, right? And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology, and the social sciences, rhetoric, philosophy, ethics, because they give us context that is so important for big data, and because they help us become better critical thinkers. Because after all, if I can spot a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers. And this means teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal from 30 yards, because something that happens after something doesn't mean it happened because of it, necessarily, and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second, the Romans called this "post hoc ergo propter hoc," after which therefore because of which. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
And it means questioning disciplines like demographics. Why? Because they're based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what we actually think and do. And since we have this data, we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls and consumer opt-in, and beyond that, we need to be clear about our hypotheses, the methodologies that we use, and our confidence in the result. As my high school algebra teacher used to say, show your math, because if I don't know what steps you took, I don't know what steps you didn't take, and if I don't know what questions you asked, I don't know what questions you didn't ask. And it means asking ourselves, really, the hardest question of all: Did the data really show us this, or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable? 	<br><br>

So the Health Media Collaboratory, at the end of their project, they were able to find that 87 percent of tweets about those very graphic and disturbing anti-smoking ads expressed fear, but did they conclude that they actually made people stop smoking? No. It's science, not magic. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:43	<br><br>
	
So if we are to unlock the power of data, we don't have to go blindly into Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future, or Huxley's vision of a trivial one, or some horrible cocktail of both. What we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the Health Media Collaboratory, and as they say in the superhero movies, let's use our powers for good. 	<br><br>

科技极大程度上改变了世界： 登月计划，互联网，基因组测序。 但随之而来的是我们内心深处的忧虑， 大约30年前， 文学评论家尼尔 波兹曼出了一本书， 名为《娱乐至死》， 将这个问题展现得淋漓尽致。 他这样写道， 将乔治 奥威尔和阿道司 赫胥黎 两人的反乌托邦观点做比较， 奥威尔害怕我们的文化成为「受制文化」。 赫胥黎担心的是我们的文化成为「琐碎文化」 奥威尔害怕的是真理被隐瞒， 赫胥黎担心的是我们被淹没在 无聊烦琐的世事中。 简言之，这是「老大哥」看你 还是你看「老大哥」的选择。 （译者注：「老大哥」典出奥威尔名著《1984》） （笑声） 	<br><br>

但事实不尽然， 我们不是只能被动地接受数据和科技。 我们能改变科技在我们生活中扮演的角色， 也能改变享受数据带来的恩惠的方式， 但要实现这一目的， 思考方式固然重要， 我们也要对如何解读数据 投以同样高的关注度。 我们需要问问题，要问深刻的问题， 不再单纯地统计数据， 而是要进一步理解数据。 我们身边充斥着那些 讲述世界上有海量数据的故事， 但当我们面临大数据， 面临理解大数据所的挑战， 数据量的大小不代表一切。 还有数据传播的速度， 数据的类型， 举几个例子： 图像， 文字， 视频， 音频。 不同类型的数据能有机地结合在一起， 因为正是人类创造了这些数据， 而且要在一定背景前提下理解特定数据。 	<br><br>

目前，一个来自伊利诺大学 芝加哥分校的数据科学家团队， 自称「健康媒体合作实验室」， 正与疾控中心合作， 试图进一步了解 人们谈论戒烟的方式， 谈论电子烟的方式， 以及他们如何协作 来帮助人们戒烟。 有趣的是，如果你想了解 人们谈论吸烟的方式， 首先需要了解 「烟」在他们口中的含义。 在Twitter上，「烟」的含义通常有四类： 第一，吸烟； 第二，抽大麻； 第三，烟熏肋排； 第四，闻香识女。 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:57	<br><br>
	
然后你就会想， 人们是如何谈论电子烟的呢？ 人们谈论电子烟的方式非常多， 从屏幕上你们可以看到谈论的方式是如此繁多。 这就让我们想到， 语言是人类创造的， 人类的语言是复杂混乱的， 我们用各种语言，无时无刻不在讲着比喻， 说着俚语和术语， 好不容易弄清了，立马就又变掉了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
那么，疾控中心投放的广告， 以及电视上那种看起来让人非常不安的 形象地画了一个喉咙烧出来洞的女性的广告， 这些广告会影响人们戒烟吗？ 健康媒体合作实验室承认其数据的有限性， 但他们还是做了这样的结论， 那些广告――或许你们都见到过―― 确实会震颤人的内心， 让他们有所思考， 这样或许会影响他们未来的行为。 这个项目让我尊重和欣赏的地方， 不仅在于该项目基于人们的真实需求， 还在于它充分诠释了面对「无聊烦琐的世事」 展现出来的勇气。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
因此，并不只是大数据在挑战我们对事物的理解， 让我们直面这一事实吧， 不管处理多少数据，哪怕再少的数据， 人们也能把它搞得一团糟， 「见多不怪」了。 你或许会记得，几年前， 前总统罗纳德 里根 在声称「事实是愚蠢的」后 被严厉指责。 平心而论，这是一个口误。 他原本是想引用约翰 亚当斯 在波士顿惨案审判为英军士兵的辩言 「事实是顽固不化的。」 但事实上，我认为 里根总统那句话蕴含着些许智慧， 事实固然顽固不化， 有时确实是愚蠢的。 	<br><br>

这对我意义深远， 我讲一个私人故事来告诉你们为什么。 我要深吸一口气。 我的儿子艾萨克，在他两岁的时候， 被诊断出患有自闭症， 在我们眼里，他是个幸福、欢快、 充满爱意、惹人喜欢的小孩， 但该发展水平评估 关注的指标是诸如言多言寡―― 当时，是零―― 互动性姿势和最少目光接触， 根据这套评估标准的结果， 他的发展水平相当于9月大的婴儿。 按照这套标准，结果无可厚非， 但这不是全部。 一年半之后， 在他快要四岁的时候， 有一天我发现他坐在电脑前， 在Google图片搜索中搜索「women」 拼成了「wimen」 接下来我做了任何有心的父母都会做的事， 我立马就按了后退按钮， 看看他还搜索了什么。 查到了，按顺序来：男人， 学校，汽车和电脑。 我目瞪口呆， 因为我们还不知道他会拼单词， 更别说读写了，因此我问他， 「艾萨克，你是如何做到的？」 他很严肃地看着我说， 「在搜索框里输入。」 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
他一直在自我学习如何去沟通， 但我们将注意力投在了别处， 很显然，那些发展水平评估 过分注重了一个指标―― 言语沟通―― 而忽视了其他指标，如问题解决能力。 沟通对于艾萨克而言很难， 所以他找到了一个变通方法， 自己去探索想要知道的信息。 你考虑一下，这确实很有道理， 因为提出一个问题 是复杂的过程， 但他能通过在搜索框中输入单词来达到同样目的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:10	<br><br>
	
因此，这一个小插曲 深深影响了我和我的家庭， 因为它让我们对发生在他身上的一切 有了全新的认识， 也不那么担心他了， 而且更加欣赏他的「人小鬼大」。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
事实是愚蠢的， 极容易被误用， 有意或无意地。 我有一个叫Emily Willingham的朋友，是科学家， 不久前他为福布斯杂志写过一篇文章， 名为《十个最奇怪的跟自闭症相关的事情》 此文深得我心。 「互联网」，一切罪恶的源头，对吧？ 当然，「母亲」也是其中一条。 事实上，没这么简单， 「母亲」还进一步细分为多条。 你们可以看到这个清单真的内涵丰富又有趣。 我很「欣赏」那些在在高速路旁怀孕的人。 最后一条很有趣， 因为「冰箱母亲」在最初被认为是 孩童自闭症的原因， 这个词表示那些冰冷的、没有爱心的人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:22	<br><br>
	
话已至此，你们也许会问， 「好吧，苏珊，我们明白了， 你能理解数据，你可以决定数据的意义。」 这是对的，这绝对是没问题的， 但挑战在于， 你们自己也有机会明白数据的意义， 因为，坦白地讲，数据自己不会创造意义， 是我们创造数据的意义。 因此，作为商人，作为消费者， 作为病人，作为公民， 我认为我们都有责任 花更多时间来锻炼批判性思维能力。 为什么？ 因为历史发展到今天， 我们总是听到这样的说法， 我们能以闪电般速度 处理海量数据， 这就意味着我们能以更快地速度做出错误的决策， 带给我们史无前例的巨大影响。 没错吧？ 因此，我们需要做的就是 多花一点时间在 人文学， 社会学，社会科学， 修辞学，哲学，伦理学， 因为这些知识非常有助于帮助我们理解大数据， 而且也能锻炼我们的批判性思维。 毕竟，如果我能在一个论断中发现问题， 这个问题是以文字还是数字的形式呈现并不那么重要。 而且，这些知识会 让我们有能力辨识出事实与偏见， 错误的关联信息， 有能力在30码开外就看透赤裸裸的情感诉求， 因为，乙事件发生在甲事件之后， 并不意味着是甲导致乙的发生， 允许我耍一下酷， 罗马人称之为 「post hoc ergo propter hoc」 即「后此谬误」。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
这意味着我们要对人口统计学 这样的学科打个问号。 为什么？因为这样的学科基于的假设是 性别、年龄和住址等数据 决定我们的身份， 而不是基于我们的思想和行为。 我们获取了这些数据， 我们需要做好隐私控制， 并保证民众的选择权， 除此之外，我们需要弄清楚所做的假设， 采用的研究方法， 以及对结果的信任。 就像高中代数老师曾对我说的， 给我看看你的解题步骤， 因为如果我不知道你的步骤， 我就不知道你落下了哪些步骤， 如果我不知道你问了些什么， 我就不知道哪些问题你没有问。 我们应该问自己这个最难回答的问题， 这真是值得的： 数据真的显示出了这个结果， 还是这样的结果让我们感觉更成功、更舒服？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:22	<br><br>
	
因此，健康媒体合作实验室 在该项目结束时发现， 谈论那些很形象、令人不安的广告的推特中， 有87%的表达出了恐惧， 但他们做出这些广告让人戒烟的结论了吗？ 没有。这是科学，但不是魔法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:43	<br><br>
	
因此，如果我们想要激发 数据中潜在的能量， 我们没必要盲目地 游走于奥威尔所谓的极端未来， 或赫胥黎所谓的琐碎的未来， 或两种思想的杂糅。 我们需要做的就是， 积极进行批判性思维， 并学习健康媒体合作实验室的做法， 就像超级英雄电影里说的那样， 力量用在行善上。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:16	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>

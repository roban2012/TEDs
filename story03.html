The beauty of hackers, says cybersecurity expert Keren Elazari, is that they force us to evolve and improve. Yes, some hackers are bad guys, but many are working to fight government corruption and advocate for our rights. By exposing vulnerabilities, they push the Internet to become stronger and healthier, wielding their power to create a better world. 	<br><br>

Four years ago, a security researcher, or, as most people would call it, a hacker, found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him. His name was Barnaby Jack, and this technique was later called "jackpotting" in his honor. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:33	<br><br>
	
I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers. Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge, but he chose to show the world his research instead. He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. And I feel the same way. That's why I'm here today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have. They scare us. But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all. So I am here today because I think we need hackers, and in fact, they just might be the immune system for the information age. Sometimes they make us sick, but they also find those hidden threats in our world, and they make us fix it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:40	<br><br>
	
I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk, so let me save you the effort. In true TED fashion, here is my most embarrassing picture. But it would be difficult for you to find me in it, because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side. I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join. This is who I was, but this is who I wanted to be: Angelina Jolie. She portrayed Acid Burn in the '95 film "Hackers." She was pretty and she could rollerblade, but being a hacker, that made her powerful. And I wanted to be just like her, so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums. I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code. I didn't really know what it did, but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that. Open Sesame. It was a simple trick, and I was just a script kiddie back then, but to me, that trick, it felt like this, like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips. This is the rush of power that hackers feel. It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower, one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect, but thankfully no radioactive spiders. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
But with great power comes great responsibility, and you all like to think that if we had such powers, we would only use them for good. But what if you could read your ex's emails, or add a couple zeros to your bank account. What would you do then? Indeed, many hackers do not resist those temptations, and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft, which is a serious issue. But there are other hackers, hackers who just like to break things, and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office. He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers, no password needed. He reported it to the company, of course, but they ignored his report. Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature, not a bug, until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files. But they didn't steal anything. They left a note: Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world. Here's what you should do to fix it. We hope we helped. By getting into people's files like that, yeah, they broke the law, but they also forced that company to fix their product. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:07	<br><br>
	
Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community, and it is controversial, but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day. This is what Khalil did. Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank, and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program. These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code. Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications, his report was not acknowledged. Frustrated with the exchange, he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall. This got their attention, all right, and they fixed the bug, but because he hadn't reported it properly, he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries. Thankfully for Khalil, a group of hackers were watching out for him. In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars to reward him for this discovery, raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing. But I think there's a greater story here still. Even companies founded by hackers, like Facebook was, still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers. And so for more conservative organizations, it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it. But I think it's worth the effort, because the alternative, to blindly fight all hackers, is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge. These are things that will come back and bite you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:17	<br><br>
	
It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web, especially in times like this, like today even, as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet. I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition, its last line of defense even, perhaps someone like Anonymous, the leading brand of global hacktivism. This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today, but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns. Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites. This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. It turns out, the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world, from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide, Australia. This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets, and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world. Since then, they've gone after many targets. They've uncovered corruption, abuse. They've hacked popes and politicians, and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents. I think that, like Robin Hood, they are in the business of redistribution, but what they are after isn't your money. It's not your documents. It's your attention. They grab the spotlight for causes they support, forcing us to take note, acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be. They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists, and I cannot justify their illegal means, but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all. The reality is, hackers can do a lot more than break things. They can bring people together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:14	<br><br>
	
And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. This took place in Egypt in January 2011, and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo, he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight. For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented, and for hackers, it made it personal. Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground, helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio. It was high season for low tech, which the government couldn't block, but when the Net went completely down, Telecomix brought in the big guns. They found European service providers that still had 20-year-old analog dial-up access infrastructure. They opened up 300 of those lines for Egyptians to use, serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians. This worked. It worked so well, in fact, one guy even used it to download an episode of "How I Met Your Mother." But while Egypt's future is still uncertain, when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later, Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines, and Anonymous, they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:06	<br><br>
	
But with this sort of power, it really depends on where you stand, because one man's hero can be another's villain, and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime. They've taken down multiple high-profile targets in the past few years, including the Associated Press's Twitter account, in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama. This tweet was fake, of course, but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not, and a lot of people lost a lot of money. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:53	<br><br>
	
This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now. In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America, from Europe to the United States, hackers are a force for social, political and military influence. As individuals or in groups, volunteers or military conflicts, there are hackers everywhere. They come from all walks of life, ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add. They are now shaping the world's stage. Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century. This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control, a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs, a thing they need hackers for, by the way. And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers, because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:06	<br><br>
	
Two years ago, I saw General Keith Alexander. He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander, but instead of his four star general uniform, he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. This was at DEF CON, the world's largest hacker conference. Perhaps like me, General Alexander didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas. I think he saw untapped potential. In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch. "In this room right here," he said, "is the talent our nation needs." Well, hackers in the back row replied, "Then stop arresting us." (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:52	<br><br>
	
Indeed, for years, hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence, but in light of what we know now, who is more watchful of our online world? The rules of the game are not that clear anymore, but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field. To me, that represents hope. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:22	<br><br>
	
For the past three decades, hackers have done a lot of things, but they have also impacted civil liberties, innovation and Internet freedom, so I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them, because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys, how can they be the heroes too? My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers: They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be. They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it, and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world. They make us, they force us to fix things or demand something better, and I think we need them to do just that, because after all, it is not information that wants to be free, it's us. 	<br><br>

Thank you very much. 	<br><br>

Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

Onstage at TED2014, Charlie Rose interviews Google CEO Larry Page about his far-off vision for the company. It includes aerial bikeways and internet balloons … and then it gets even more interesting, as Page talks through the company’s recent acquisition of Deep Mind, an AI that is learning some surprising things. 	<br><br>

Charlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email and he basically said, we've got to make sure that we don't seem like we're a couple of middle-aged boring men. I said, I'm flattered by that -- (Laughter) ― because I'm a bit older, and he has a bit more net worth than I do. 	<br><br>

CR: So we'll have a conversation about the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google, and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy, and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question: Where is Google and where is it going? LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot, and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say, is that really what you guys are still doing? And I always kind of think about that myself, and I'm not quite sure. But actually, when I think about search, it's such a deep thing for all of us, to really understand what you want, to understand the world's information, and we're still very much in the early stages of that, which is totally crazy. We've been at it for 15 years already, but it's not at all done. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:47	<br><br>
	
CR: When it's done, how will it be? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
LP: Well, I guess, in thinking about where we're going -- you know, why is it not done? -- a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know, your computer doesn't know where you are, it doesn't know what you're doing, it doesn't know what you know, and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work, make them understand your context. Google Now, you know, knows where you are, knows what you may need. So really having computing work and understand you and understand that information, we really haven't done that yet. It's still very, very clunky. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:28	<br><br>
	
CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing, where does Deep Mind fit? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:33	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First, let me tell you the way we got there, which was looking at search and really understanding, trying to understand everything, and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you -- like, voice was really important. So what's the state of the art on speech recognition? It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube? But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself. Now, that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are, that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind, what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually -- they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games, and really just, maybe I can show the video, just playing video games, and learning how to do that automatically. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
CR: Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:54	<br><br>
	
LP: The amazing thing about this is this is, I mean, obviously, these are old games, but the system just sees what you see, the pixels, and it has the controls and it has the score, and it's learned to play all of these games, same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing, and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left, and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule, or your information needs, or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that, and that's what I'm really excited about. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:43	<br><br>
	
CR: When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing, also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we, when you look at that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:56	<br><br>
	
LP: Well, I think for me, this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company, Demis, has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
CR: But where's the level of it now? And how fast do you think we are moving? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:30	<br><br>
	
LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now, understanding cats on YouTube and things like that, improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally, but I think for me, this example's really exciting, because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:51	<br><br>
	
CR: I don't know if we can do this, but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:00	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah. CR: There it is. Can you see the cat? Designed by machines, seen by machines. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:04	<br><br>
	
LP: That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training, no notion of a cat, but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand, and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part, it started with search, really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:34	<br><br>
	
(Video) ["Soy, Kenya"] 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:39	<br><br>
	
Zack Matere: Not long ago, I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and they didn't tell me much. So, I went and I did a search. ["Zack Matere, Farmer"] Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone, I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information, but there's no follow-up to that. I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge, they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful, but it is how we use it that will define us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:29	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:33	<br><br>
	
LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video, actually, was we just read about it in the news, and we found this gentlemen, and made that little clip. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:42	<br><br>
	
CR: When I talk to people about you, they say to me, people who know you well, say, Larry wants to change the world, and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community, and this is an example. LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me, I have been focusing on access more, if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually, two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost-efficiently. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:30	<br><br>
	
CR: It's a balloon. LP: Yeah, get access to the Internet. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:33	<br><br>
	
CR: And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet? Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible, they didn't have to be tethered. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:43	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation. Like, we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it, but it was just really, how do we get access points up high, cheaply? You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up, and actually again, it's the power of the Internet, I did a search on it, and I found, 30, 40 years ago, someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought, why can't we do that today? And that's how this project got going. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:23	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, but it turns out, we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before, and if you control the altitude of the balloons, which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways, you can actually control roughly where they go, and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:44	<br><br>
	
CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation, where you've been a nerd for a while, and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles, let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:02	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think, for me, I guess, privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things, and I think you can't have privacy without security, so let me just talk about security first, because you asked about Snowden and all of that, and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from, but we do need to know what the parameters of it is, what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why, and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:10	<br><br>
	
CR: Never coming to Google to ask for anything. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:14	<br><br>
	
LP: Not Google, but the public. I think we need to have a debate about that, or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:34	<br><br>
	
CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:37	<br><br>
	
LP: Yes. The privacy side, I think it's -- the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you, and that's an important thing, and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit -- I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice, show them what data's being collected -- search history, location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome, and doing that in more ways, just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at, on your show, actually, I kind of lost my voice, and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:39	<br><br>
	
CR: If I could do anything, I would do that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:40	<br><br>
	
LP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think, you know what, I look at that, I made that public, and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues, and I look at medical records, and I say, wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors? And when someone accesses your medical record, a research doctor, they could see, you could see which doctor accessed it and why, and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that, we'd save 100,000 lives this year. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:25	<br><br>
	
CR: Absolutely. Let me go ― (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
LP: So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy, we're doing the same thing we're doing with medical records, is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:46	<br><br>
	
CR: And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:53	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that, and it was a great thing to do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:00	<br><br>
	
CR: And the response has been overwhelming. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:01	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions, which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:11	<br><br>
	
CR: So talking about the future, what is it about you and transportation systems? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost, and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:37	<br><br>
	
CR: And that began the idea of an automated car. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:40	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about people working on automated cars, and I became fascinated by that, and it takes a while to get these projects going, but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's 20 million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under 34 in the U.S. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:04	<br><br>
	
CR: So you're talking about saving lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:06	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads, half of the area, and most cities are not far behind, actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:24	<br><br>
	
CR: And how soon will we be there? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:27	<br><br>
	
LP: I think we can be there very, very soon. We've driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:40	<br><br>
	
CR: But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:44	<br><br>
	
LP: Well at Google, we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone, and that's been amazing, most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere, and the bikes wear out. They're getting used 24 hours a day. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:58	<br><br>
	
CR: But you want to put them above the street, too. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:00	<br><br>
	
LP: Well I said, how do we get people using bikes more? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:03	<br><br>
	
CR: We may have a video here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:04	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, let's show the video. I just got excited about this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:09	<br><br>
	
(Music) So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway, it looks totally crazy, but I was actually thinking about our campus, working with the Zippies and stuff, and just trying to get a lot more bike usage, and I was thinking about, how do you cost-effectively separate the bikes from traffic? And I went and searched, and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this, that particular thing, but it gets your imagination going. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:47	<br><br>
	
CR: Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind. You have this idea of [Google X]. You don't simply want to go in some small, measurable arena of progress. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:02	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, I think many of the things we just talked about are like that, where they're really -- I almost use the economic concept of additionality, which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that, the bigger impact you have, and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed, the more I learn about technology, the more I realize I don't know, and that's because this technological horizon, the thing that you can see to do next, the more you learn about technology, the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:51	<br><br>
	
CR: What's interesting about you too, though, for me, is that, we have lots of people who are thinking about the future, and they are going and looking and they're coming back, but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about, Tesla. The principle of that for you is what? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:11	<br><br>
	
LP: Well, I think invention is not enough. If you invent something, Tesla invented electric power that we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things, where we have an innovation and invention focus, plus the ability to really -- a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that, because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:53	<br><br>
	
CR: Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:02	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did 50 years ago or 20 years ago. That's not really what we need. We need, especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:24	<br><br>
	
CR: You once said, actually, as I think I've got this about right, that you might consider, rather than giving your money, if you were leaving it to some cause, just simply giving it to Elon Musk, because you had confidence that he would change the future, and that you would therefore ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:41	<br><br>
	
LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars, he wants to go to Mars, to back up humanity, that's a worthy goal, but it's a company, and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well? I mean, but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies, and I think it's sad, because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is, where a lot of the money is, and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:33	<br><br>
	
CR: When I close conversations with lots of people, I always ask this question: What state of mind, what quality of mind is it that has served you best? People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity, and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind, as I leave this audience, has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
22:00	<br><br>
	
LP: You know, I think the most important thing -- I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong? What did those companies all do wrong? And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think, for me, I just try to focus on that and say, what is that future really going to be and how do we create it, and how do we cause our organization, to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate? And so that's been curiosity, it's been looking at things people might not think about, working on things that no one else is working on, because that's where the additionality really is, and be willing to do that, to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future, right? That was a good thing to be working on. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:08	<br><br>
	
CR: It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you, and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks, Larry. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:14	<br><br>
	
LP: Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:16	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:20	<br><br>
	
CR: Larry Page. 	<br><br>
	
0:14	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：拉里给我发了一封邮件， 基本上他就是说， 我们得确保我们看起来不能像 两个乏味的中年人。 我回他说，你这么讲我深感荣幸-- （笑声）-- 因为我年纪大一点， 而他的净资产又比我多一点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:39	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：呵呵，谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:41	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我们将要谈谈互联网， 我们还会谈谈Google， 以及搜索 和隐私， 还有你思考的基本原则， 以及你是如何把这些点点滴滴联接起来的， 以及多年前开始的 这个发展历程， 具有怎样的有趣前景。 我们主要来讨论一下未来。 那我的第一个问题是：Google现在何处， 它要前往何方？ 拉里・佩奇：好的，这个问题我们思考过很多， 我们很早以前所定下的使命 就是将全世界的信息组织起来 让全世界的人们可以获得它并且从中受益。 人们总在说， 你们还在做这个的事情呀？ 我自己也算是常常思考这个问题， 我还不是很确定。 但事实上，当我思考搜索时， 它对我们所有人来说是个深刻的问题， 要真正理解你想要的是什么， 要理解这个世界的信息， 我们还处于非常早期的阶段， 这太让人着急了。 我们在这个领域里已有十五年， 但是离实现它还差得很远。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:47	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：当你们实现时，它会是什么样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我猜， 想想我们的前进方向-- 你知道，为什么还没有完成？-- 很大程度是因为数据计算还是一团乱麻。 你知道，你的电脑并不知道你在哪里， 它不知道你在做什么， 它不知道你知道什么。 而且近来花费了我们很大精力的事情， 仅仅是让你的设备工作起来， 让它理解你的大致意图。 Google Now（一款个人助理软件）知道你人在哪里， 知道你可能需要什么。 所以让计算机真正地工作起来，理解你 并且理解这些信息， 我们真的还没有做到那一步。 它还是非常非常的不成熟。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:28	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：你讲一讲，当你看着谷歌正在做的工作， DeepMind应该处于什么位置？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:33	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：DeepMind 这家公司， 我们最近才整合进来。 它在英国。 首先，我来讲一下我们当时的状况， 就是我们正在关注搜索， 真正地理解， 试图理解所有一切， 让电脑不那么不成熟， 并且真正地理解你-- 比如，声音非常重要。 那么，语音识别技术的最高水平是怎样的？ 它不是很好， 它并不能真正地理解你。 于是我们开展了机器学习方面的研究， 来改进它， 结果成效很大。 然后我们开始转向YouTube之类的东西。 我们可以理解YouTube吗？ 但是我们确实在Youtube上运行机器学习， 它找到了猫，完全靠自己。 现在，这就是一个重要的概念。 我们就意识到，其中有些深义。 如果我们能学习什么是猫， 那一定是非常重要的。 所以我认为DeepMind， 它的真正神奇之处 在于它真的可以 -- 可以自主学习，无需人的干预。 他们从视频游戏开始， 真的只是，也许我可以展示一下那个视频， 只是玩视频游戏， 并且学习怎样自动地玩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：来看一下视频游戏， 机器是如何开始有能力 做一些惊人的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:54	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：这件事的惊人之处在于， 我觉得很明显， 这些都是老游戏， 但是系统和你看到的完全一样，就是像素， 并且它能控制，能得分， 还有它学会了所有这些游戏， 同一个程序。 它学会了所有这些游戏， 而且表现是超人级的。 在以前用电脑是做不到这样的事情的。 在以前用电脑是做不到这样的事情的。 我要简单说明一下， 这是拳击游戏，系统计算出它可以 将对手击败。 左边的是电脑， 它就是要赢得高分。 所以设想一下，如果这样的 智能可以应用在你的日程中， 或是用来解决你的信息需求，或是类似的事情。 机器学习其实还只在起步阶段， 而它让我感到无比激动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:43	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：当你看到DeepMind和拳击游戏 上所发生的这一切， 并且人工智能 也是我们前进的方向之一。 你从这些能看到，我们走到哪一步了呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:56	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我认为对于我来说， 这是我看到的最令人激动的事情之一， 在很长时间以来。 创立这家公司的戴米斯 拥有神经学和计算机科学的背景。 他重返校园攻读博士学位， 课题是研究大脑。 所以，我觉得我们看到了许多令人激动的成果， 出现在神经学与计算机科学交叉的领域。 出现在神经学与计算机科学交叉的领域。 这些成果有关于真正去理解 要怎样才能制造出智能机器， 然后做一些非常有趣的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我们现在处于什么阶段呢？ 你觉得我们的前进速度如何？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:30	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：这是当前达到的最高水平， 理解Youtube上的猫 还有类似的事情， 改进语音识别技术。 我们使用了许多机器学习 来逐步改进各种问题， 但我个人认为，这个例子真的非常令人激动， 因为它只是一款程序 却可以做许多不同事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:51	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我不知道这样做可不可以， 我这儿有一张猫的图片， 这张图意义非凡。 这就是机器如何看着猫， 然后它们反映出来的形象。 我们可以看下那张图片吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:00	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：好的。 查理・罗斯：这就是了。你能看到猫吗？ 机器设计了它，然后看到了它。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:04	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的。 这是仅仅通过观看Youtube学到的。 没有训练过， 事先没有猫的概念， 但是这个猫的概念挺重要的， 我们都知道， 而现在机器也有了一定理解。 也许它已经完成了搜索这部分， 也许它已经完成了搜索这部分， 它从搜索开始，真正理解人的意图 和他们的信息。 我有一个视频， 我想快速展示一下 我发现了什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:34	<br><br>
	
（视频）[肯尼亚・索伊] 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:39	<br><br>
	
扎克・马泰尔：不久之前， 我种了一片土豆， 然后突然不断地有土豆死掉了。 我从书里查找，但没发现多少信息， 所以我去搜索了一下。 ["扎克・马泰尔，农民"] 土豆　病 有一个网站告诉我 问题可能是蚂蚁。 它说，在作物上撒一些木灰。 几天之后蚂蚁消失了。 互联网让我非常激动。 我有个朋友， 他很想把生意做大， 于是我和他一起去了网吧， 我们查看了一些网站。 当我再次见到他的时候， 他准备在当地学校建一座风车。 我觉得很高兴， 因为一个以前没有的东西， 就这样突然出现了。 我意识到， 我用上的东西 却不是所有人都能用上。 我想我要有互联网， 我的奶奶也可以用它。 所以我想到了一个公告栏， 一个简单的木头公告栏。 我从手机上得到信息的时候， 我就可以把它 公布在公告栏上。 所以，它有点像个电脑， 我用互联网来帮助别人。 我认为我是在搜索 一个更好的生活， 为我，也为我的邻居们。 这样许多人都可以得到信息， 但是在这之后就没有后续了。 我认为“后续”就是我们的知识。 人们有了知识， 他们就可以找到方法， 而不需要找人帮忙。 信息就是力量， 但是如何使用信息才决定了我们的未来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:29	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:33	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：这段视频的精彩这处在于， 其实是我们先在新闻里看到这件事， 然后我们找到了这位先生， 制作了这段视频。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:42	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：当我和别人说起你， 他们是些很了解你的人，他们对我说， 拉里想要改变世界， 他相信技术可以指出道路， 也就是接入互联网。 这一定和语言有关。 这也意味着，人们要如何访问互联网， 来做一些事情，会影响到他所在的群体。 这就是一个例子。 拉里・佩奇：是的，对我来说， 我一直关注于更广泛和便利的网络联接， 如果我们说的是未来的话。 我们最近推出了Loon Project项目， 用热气球来实现接入互联网， 听起来很疯狂。 我们可以在这里放一下视频。 事实上，现在世界上有三分之二的人 无法访问互联网。 我们认为这个项目真的可以帮助人们， 并且费用低廉。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:30	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：这是一个气球。 拉里・佩奇：是的，可以联网。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:33	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：为什么通过这个气球就可以联网？ 查理・罗斯：为什么通过这个气球就可以联网？ 因为你得想出一些有趣的办法， 因为你得想出一些有趣的办法， 来让气球的办法成为可能， 还不用给气球插上线。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:43	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，这一个关于创新的好例子。 在我们开始着手之前， 我们已经在思考这个想法了， 有五年甚至更久， 但问题在于， 如何才能便宜地在天上设一个接入点？ 通常的办法得用人造卫星， 但发射需要很长时间。 然后我们就看到，把一个气球放到天上， 是多么简单的事， 事实上，这再一次说明了互联网的力量。 我确实搜索过这件事， 我发现三四十年前 就有人放出过一个气球， 而且这个气球绕着地球转了不少圈。 然后我想，为什么今天我们不可以做呢？ 这个项目就这样开始了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：但是你受到风的影响大吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:23	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，但实际上， 我们做了一些气象模拟， 很可能以前从来没人做过， 如果控制气球的高度， 可以通过充气或别的方法实现， 可以通过充气或别的方法实现， 就可以大致控制气球的运动， 因此，我想我们可以建造一个世界性网络， 用这些气球来覆盖全球。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:44	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：在我们谈谈未来和交通之前－－ 这两样你已经痴迷了有一段时间。 你对交通、 自动驾驶汽车和自行车相当痴迷－－ 我先提一下有关爱德华・斯诺登的话题， 稍早之前也是TED主题， 事关安全与隐私。 这个问题你一定一直有所考虑。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:02	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，毫无疑问。 昨天我看到了谢尔盖和爱德华・斯诺登的照片。 在座的有些人应该也看到了。 但我个人觉得， 隐私和安全是非常重要的事情。 我们在这两方面都有所思考， 我认为没有安全就不存在隐私， 所以我先谈谈安全， 因为你问到了有关斯诺登的事情， 然后我会再讲一点隐私。 我个人感到极度失望， 就是政府偷偷地做了所有这些事， 而且没有告诉我们。 我认为这样背离了民主， 如果有些事大家还从未讨论过， 而我们不得不防止政府 来侵犯你和我们的用户的这些事情， 我倒不是说我们必须知道 政府所担心的具体的恐怖袭击是什么， 政府所担心的具体的恐怖袭击是什么， 而是我们需要知道 事情应当符合什么条件， 政府要进行何种监控， 打算怎么做，为什么这样做， 我认为我们并没有讨论过这些问题。 所以我认为政府偷偷地做了所有这些事情， 实际上造成了严重的伤害。 实际上造成了严重的伤害。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:10	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：绝不要找Google 要任何东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:14	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：不是Google，而是公众。 我认为我们需要讨论一下这个问题， 否则我们的民主就名不副实。 这不可能称为民主。 所以Google处在了这样一个位置上， 要防止政府偷偷做这些我们根本不知道的事情， 防止它侵犯你和我们的用户， 这让我觉得荒唐， 这毫无道理。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:34	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：没错，然后还有隐私方面的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:37	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，还有隐私一面， 我认为，世界正在变化。 你带个手机，它知道你在哪里。 还有许多你的个人信息， 这是件非常重要的事情， 人们因此而提出难以回答的问题， 是合情合理的。 我们花了很多时间去思考这一点， 以及问题所在。 我有一点-- 我认为我们需要做的事情里最主要的一点， 就是让人们可以选择， 告诉他们什么数据会被收集-- 搜索记录，位置信息。 我们对于Chrome浏览器的匿名模式感到很兴奋， 将它应用到更多的方面， 也就是给予人们更多选择， 让他们更好地认识到发生了什么事。 我也认为这非常简单。 我所担心的是， 我们把孩子和洗澡水一起倒掉了。 我看到，在你的节目上， 我嗓子有点哑了， 我还没有恢复。 我希望和你聊聊 能恢复得快一点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:39	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：如果我能帮上什么忙，我一定会帮。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:40	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：那好，拿出你的劈邪宝剑， 该怎么做你就尽管做。 但是我认为，我看着这件事， 我把它公开化了， 我得到了所有这些信息。 我做过一个关于身体状况的调查， 调查对象都有些类似的问题。 我一边看着医疗记录，一边说， 如果每个人的医疗记录 都可以匿名地提供给 做研究的医生， 那岂不是很好？ 当有人查看你的医疗记录时， 一个做研究的医生， 他们可以看到，你也可以看到 是哪一位医生看了，和为什么要看， 然后你也许可以了解到 你的状况如何。 我认为如果我们做到这一点， 这一年里就可以拯救十万人的生命。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:25	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：毫无疑问。我想要--（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：所以我想我就是非常担心 这件事与互联网隐私的问题。 我们现在面对的问题和面对医疗记录时一样， 就是我们把孩子和洗澡水一起倒掉了， 我们没有真正地思考过 信息共享带来的巨大益处， 人们分享信息， 要与正确的人分享，并且用正确的方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:46	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：还有一个必要条件， 就是人们得有信心， 相信他们的信息不会被滥用。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:53	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，我在我的声音上有同样的问题， 我害怕分享出来。 谢尔盖鼓励我这么做， 这件事非常值得一做。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:00	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：而且大家的反应出奇地好。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:01	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇；是的，而且人们的反应极为正面。 我们调查了成千上万的人， 都有类似的状况， 而这些数据至今都是没有的。 所以这是一件非常好的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:11	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：说到未来，你怎么看？ 还有交通问题？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我在密歇根州读大学的时候， 我是感到非常沮丧的。 我必须坐公共汽车， 还要等它。 当时很冷，又在下雪。 我就做了一点研究，公共交通的成本问题， 然后我就有点迷上了交通系统。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:37	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：于是就有了自动驾驶汽车的想法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:40	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，大约18年前我了解到 有人在研究自动驾驶， 我被深深地吸引住了， 让这些项目有所进展得花点时间， 但是想到有可能让世界变得更好， 我感到无比激动。 每年有超过两千万人受伤。 这是美国34岁以下人群 死亡的主要原因。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:04	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：所以这么说就是拯救生命了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:06	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，也是节省空间 和让生活更美好。 在洛杉矶一半的土地都是停车场和道路， 一半的土地， 而且大部分城市其实也差不多了。 这实在是太疯狂了， 我们把空间就用来作这个用途。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:24	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我们什么时候可以实现？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:27	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我想非常、非常快就可以实现了。 我们已经良好运行了十万英里（16万公里）， 现在完全是自动行驶。 能够这么快地实现它，让我无比激动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:40	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：但你考虑的不只是自动驾驶汽车， 你对自行车也有这样的想法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:44	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：在Google，我们有一个想法， 我们应该向每一个人提供免费自行车， 这非常棒，对大多数旅行都是。 你看，自行车哪里都可以去， 而自行车会磨损， 它一天24小时都在使用。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:58	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：但你也想把自行车放到街道上。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:00	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我就说， 怎样才可以让人们更多地使用自行车呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:03	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我们这儿有一段视频。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:04	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：好，我们来放一下视频， 这个让我非常激动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:09	<br><br>
	
（音乐） 其实这就是把自行车与汽车分离开来的方法， 而且代价最小。 当然了，看起来很疯狂， 但实际上我考虑的是我们的校园， 和许多城市等等一起合作， 就是想大大提高自行车使用率， 我还在想， 我们怎样才能有效并且廉价地 把自行车从车流中分离开来？ 我做了研究， 这就是我所得到的。 我们其实没有研究这个， 我是说这个具体方案， 但它扩展了想象力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:47	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我们把这个话题先告一段落， 描述一下你的想法有着怎样的基本原则。 你有了Google X这个想法， 你想要的不只是一些 小的，规模有限的舞台。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:02	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，我认为 我们刚讨论过的许多事情就是这样， 它们真是-- 我差点要用经济学概念上的额外性了， 就是说，你要做的事情本来并不会发生， 除非你是真的在做它。 我认为这样的事情你做得越多， 你获得的影响就越大， 人们也许认为不可能的事情 就应当这样做。 我惊讶地发现， 我懂得的技术越多， 就越意识到自己的不足。 这是因为技术的眼界提高了， 也就是你预见下一步应当怎么做的能力。 你懂得的技术越多， 你就越知道什么是可能的。 你现在知道气球项目是可能的， 因为有了一些材料让它可以运作起来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:51	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：不过在我看来，你的有趣之处在于， 有很多的人在思考未来， 有很多的人在思考未来， 他们去了看了看，又回来了， 而我们从来没有看到最终实现。 我想到了一个人，你一定知道， 特斯拉。 你在这方面的原则是怎样的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:11	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我认为仅仅有发明是不够的。 如果你发明一样东西， 特斯拉发明了电力系统，我们现在用的就是， 但是他推广起来就非常困难， 普及是由别人实现的， 花费了很长时间。 我认为，如果我们能将二者真正结合起来， 同时着眼于创新与发明， 再加上一家公司， 可以使成果真正商业化， 让人们接触到它， 让它对世界有积极地影响， 并给人们带来希望。 你知道，大家对气球项目的关注程度 让我很是吃惊， 因为它带来了希望， 对于世界上现在还不能上网的三分之二来说， 这怎样都是好事。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:53	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：这就是关于公司的第二件事。 有些人，包括你，认为， 公司可以成为带来改变的媒介， 如果它能运营良好的话。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:02	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，大部分人认为公司基本上都是邪恶的， 这让我很是沮丧， 这么说并不公正， 但我认为在某程度上又是正确的。 公司做的事情就是渐进发展， 五十年前的公司就这样做， 或者说二十年前， 这也并非是我们真正需要的。 我们需要的是，特别是在技术上， 是革命性改变， 而不是渐进式改变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:24	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：你曾说过， 我希望我的理解是对的， 就是，你可能考虑， 相比于直接捐出你的钱， 你更愿意用于某些事业， 只管给伊隆・马斯克就好了， 因为你相信 他会改变未来， 因此你就会-- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:41	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：是的，如果你想去火星， 他想去火星， 来为人类探索后备方案， 这个目标很有价值，但这是一个公司， 这是慈善事业。 所以我觉得我们的目标是做些类似的事情。 你问过，我们在Google有许多员工， 他们非常富有， 通过技术赚了很多钱， 很多人都非常富有。 你工作的目的是想要改变世界， 你想让世界变得更好。 你既然为这家公司工作， 为什么不值得为它投入你的时间， 还有你的金钱呢？ 我的意思是，我们并不这样认为， 我们也不是这样看待公司的。 我也觉得很伤感， 因为我们所付出的努力绝大部分都花在了公司上。 人们在这里付出了最多的时间， 也花费了许多金钱， 所以我想我要帮助大家， 而不是只顾自己。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:33	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：我跟许多人的谈话结束时， 我总是问这样的一个问题： 什么样的心理状态， 什么样的精神品质， 让你最为受益‘？ 像鲁珀特・默多克这样的人说是好奇心， 别的媒体人士也这样说。 比尔・盖茨和沃伦・巴菲特说是专注， 在我与观众说再见之际， 什么样的精神品质 使得你能够思考未来， 而且与此同时， 改变现在？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
22:00	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：我认为最重要的事情， 我见过很多公司， 为什么我认为它们没能经受时间的考验。 如今公司的人员流动更快， 我问，他们出错的根源是什么？ 这些公司都错在了哪里？ 通常仅仅是因为他们错失了未来。 所以在我看来， 我就是专注于这一点，并且在想， 未来将真正走向何方， 我们要如何创造未来， 我们怎样才能让我们的组织 真正专注于它， 并且很快地行动呢？ 所以那就是好奇心， 去寻找人们 可能没有想过的东西， 研究别人所没有研究过的东西， 因为那才是真正的额外性， 同时乐于去做， 乐于承担风险。 看看安卓， 为安卓而工作曾让我感到内疚， 在它刚起步时， 我们收购它时，它只是很小的一步。 它当时也不是我们真正努力的方向。 为它花时间让我感到内疚， 那真是非常愚蠢。 那其实就是未来，对吧？ 那是个很棒的东西，值得为之努力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:08	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：很高兴在这里见到你， 很高兴听到你的讲述， 和你一起坐在这里也是我的荣幸。 谢谢拉里。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:14	<br><br>
	
拉里・佩奇：谢谢你。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:16	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:20	<br><br>
	
查理・罗斯：拉里・佩奇。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">The NSA responds to Edward Snowden’s TED Talk</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
After a surprise appearance by Edward Snowden at TED2014, Chris Anderson said: "If the NSA wants to respond, please do." And yes, they did. Appearing by video, NSA deputy director Richard Ledgett answers Anderson’s questions about the balance between security and protecting privacy. 	<br><br>
Richard Ledgett	<br><br>
 Mar 2014	<br><br>
	
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago, and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director of the National Security Agency, and he's a senior civilian officer there, acts as its chief operating officer, guiding strategies, setting internal policies, and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well, welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation, so thanks for arranging for that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
CA: Thank you, Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw, I think, the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it? RL: So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he was going to show up there, so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that, like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information, there were some kernels of truth in there, but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there, and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally, and I think it is important and of import, and so given that, we need to have that be a fact-based conversation, and we want to help make that happen. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:15	<br><br>
	
CA: So the question that a lot of people have here is, what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did, and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:29	<br><br>
	
RL: He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone, and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA -- and there are over 35,000 people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters, brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives, all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally, and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off, there's their supervisor, and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that, there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option of the NSA inspector general, the Navy inspector general, the Pacific Command inspector general, the Department of Defense inspector general, and the intelligence community inspector general, any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. (CA and RL speaking at once) He had the option to go to congressional committees, and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place, and so he didn't do any of those things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:54	<br><br>
	
CA: Now, you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things: one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor, the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available, two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers, like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated pretty harshly, by some views, and thirdly, what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered, but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean, in that circumstance, couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:40	<br><br>
	
RL: No, I don't agree with that. I think that the ― sorry, I'm getting feedback through the microphone there ― the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that he put people's lives at risk, basically, in the long run, and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk, and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other, and then the judicial branch, which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:54	<br><br>
	
CA: Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:59	<br><br>
	
RL: Yeah, sure. So the things that he's disclosed, the capabilities, and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization, so when we have foreign intelligence targets, legitimate things of interest -- like, terrorists is the iconic example, but it includes things like human traffickers, drug traffickers, people who are trying to build advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons, and build delivery systems for those, and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors, which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now, the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this," they move away from that, and we have seen targets in terrorism, in the nation-state area, in smugglers of various types, and other folks who have, because of the disclosures, moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places, whether they're diplomats or military, and our allies who are in similar situations, are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:25	<br><br>
	
CA: So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations, access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down, has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:54	<br><br>
	
RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them, I need to have the capability to go after them, and again, the controls are in how I apply that capability, not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise, if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet, we could have a domain, badguy.com. That would be awesome, and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions, and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission, which is to protect the national security systems of the United States, and by that, that's things like the communications that the president uses, the communications that control our nuclear weapons, the communications that our military uses around the world, and the communications that we use with our allies, and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use, and we use those same standards, and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:42	<br><br>
	
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large, any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion, that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens, what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint, it feels outrageous? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:37	<br><br>
	
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet, and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of that, but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having, and we want to participate in that, and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things, let me talk there a little bit more, there are things that we need to be transparent about: our authorities, our processes, our oversight, who we are. We, NSA, have not done a good job of that, and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about, because it's bad for the U.S., it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people, it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against, the generally recognized bad guys, to counter those. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:19	<br><br>
	
CA: But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter? RL: It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position, as are we, because the companies, we compel them to provide information, just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security, and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France, any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as "you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them" is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage, and it's being marketed that way by several countries, including some of our allied countries, where they are saying, "Hey, you can't trust the U.S., but you can trust our telecom company, because we're safe." And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:57	<br><br>
	
CA: You're sitting there with the American flag, and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy? Is there such a right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:15	<br><br>
	
RL: Yeah, of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure, inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say, amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that, the privacy of citizens around the world, it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First, we're all in the same network. My communications, I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world, number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business, and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out, that says, when you find that, not if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it, here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then, for people, citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day-to-day basis, the president on his January 17 speech, laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely, folks do have a right to privacy, and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:51	<br><br>
	
CA: What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services? Do they have any privacy rights? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:58	<br><br>
	
RL: They do. They do, in the sense of, the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories: We can identify that this particular person, identified by a selector of some kind, is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:27	<br><br>
	
CA: Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth. But it's been argued, and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data, because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn? Is there anything to that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:03	<br><br>
	
RL: I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity, or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons-related material to a country like Iran or North Korea, is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy, which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata, in that sense, actually is privacy-enhancing. And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed, we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets, you are not of interest to us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:07	<br><br>
	
CA: So in terms of the threats that face America overall, where would you place terrorism? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:15	<br><br>
	
RL: I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo, used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now, in places like Syria, where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers, thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity, and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States, and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq, which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence, again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again, lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways: One way, and probably the most common way that people have heard about it, is due to the theft of intellectual property, so basically, foreign countries going in, stealing companies' secrets, and then providing that information to state-owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation-states are doing it. Second is the denial-of-service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since 2012. Again, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks, and they're doing that as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks, and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012, August of 2012. It took down about 35,000 of their computers with a Wiper-style virus. You had a follow-on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of 2013, you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise, and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:10	<br><br>
	
CA: Okay, so a couple of things here, because this is really the core of this, almost. I mean, first of all, a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September 11, I think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years about 500 Americans have died from terrorism, mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:51	<br><br>
	
RL: Well, I'd say two things. One is, the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since 9/11, that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done, that other folks in the intelligence community have done, that the military has done, and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was 54, 25 of those in Europe, and of those 25, 18 of them occurred in three countries, some of which are our allies, and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs, by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another, through law enforcement, through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat is not at all far-fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:05	<br><br>
	
CA: It's also been said that, of those 54 alleged incidents, that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed, that it was basically through other forms of intelligence, that you're looking for a needle in a haystack, and the effects of these programs, these controversial programs, is just to add hay to the stack, not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:37	<br><br>
	
RL: No, there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section 215 program, the U.S. telephony metadata program, and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program, and it's actually section 702 of the FISA Amendment Act. But the 215 program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States, and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no "but for" case, and so there is no case where, but for that, the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television, you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with? You start with a body, and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that, hopefully before there are any bodies, and we're trying to build the case for who the people are, what they're trying to do, and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic, and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic, but to build the complete picture, you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other, the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54, the other 42 of them, the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that, and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:09:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world "a cover for action," that it's something that, because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people, it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:34:00	<br><br>
	
RL: Yeah. I mean, we debate these things all the time, and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right, what's proportionate, what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents, two different political parties, by Congress twice, and by federal judges 16 different times, and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government, and President Madison would have been proud. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:21:00	<br><br>
	
CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered what was actually being done with that authorization, many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction, that it's only because it's now come out publicly, that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:41:00	<br><br>
	
RL: Congress is a big body. There's 535 of them, and they change out frequently, in the case of the House, every two years, and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees, and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware, and in fact a significant number of them, the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility, did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA: Now, you mentioned the threat of cyberattacks, and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern, but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies, and that it's possible that the very measures taken to, "weaken encryption," and allow yourself to find the bad guys, might also open the door to forms of cyberattack? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:44:00	<br><br>
	
RL: So I think two things. One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions, and we are heavily biased towards defense, and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases, we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that, and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again, we eat our own dog food. We use the standards, we use the products that we recommend, and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:44:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Edward Snowden, when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here in the bot, and I heard him say to a couple of people, they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall, and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you, said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing, and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least, even if you disagree with how he did it, that he has opened a debate that matters? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:33:00	<br><br>
	
RL: So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:58:00	<br><br>
	
CA: It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss, General Keith Alexander, has said that that would be a terrible example for others; you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that, if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents, that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:30:00	<br><br>
	
RL: Yeah, so actually, this is my favorite thing about that "60 Minutes" interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said, in response to a question about, would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden, I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this, and I defer to the attorney general, because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to, if it benefits the government, to get something out of that, that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome, but there is always room for discussion. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:21:00	<br><br>
	
CA: To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S., the government, you, others, in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy, a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see, has that kind of possibility been entertained at all? RL: So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:53:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk, I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:04:00	<br><br>
	
RL: So I think, learn the facts. This is a really important conversation, and it impacts, it's not just NSA, it's not just the government, it's you, it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government, and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines, don't rely on sound bites, don't rely on one-sided conversations. So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading. We have a sign, a badge tab, we wear badges at work with lanyards, and if I could make a plug, my badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys." Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience, I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto-analytic work have a tab that says, "Look at the data." So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:00:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage, I think, actually, to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past, and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:18:00	<br><br>
	
RL: Thanks, Chris. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:20:00	<br><br>

克里斯 安德森：爱德华 斯诺登 数天前在这里发表演说， 现在是应答时间。 我收到来自你们的反馈 有些问题想要询问， 这位来自美国国家安全局的客人。 理查德 莱杰特是第15任 美国国安局副局长， 他是一名资深的文职官员， 是首席运营官， 指导策略，制定内部政策， 并担任国安局局长的首席顾问。 一切都很顺利， 欢迎理查德 莱杰特 来到 TED 讲台。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特: 我非常感谢有这个机会， 能在这里和大家交流。 我非常期待这次的交谈， 谢谢你的安排。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 谢谢你，理查德。 我们感到十分荣幸。 这是相当有力的声明 表现出美国国家安全局 是愿意接触公众的， 同时表现出更加开放的态度。 我认为， 几天前在这里， 我们和爱德华 斯诺登的对谈。 你有怎样的评论呢？ 理查德 莱杰特：我认为这很有趣。 我们没想到他会在那里出现， 感谢你们安排 这样有趣的惊喜。 我认为，像很多的事情爆发出来 自从斯诺登先生 开始披露保密信息资料， 有一些是事实真相， 但也带有大量的猜测 和半真半假的故事， 我很乐意就此提出见解。 我认为这是一个非常重要的对话 对美国 和在国际社会来说都是这样， 我认为这是至关重要的， 因此我们需要的是 基于事实的对话， 我们愿意为此做出努力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:15	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森: 在这儿，很多人感到好奇的问题是， 你认为斯诺登的动机是什么 他为什么要这样做， 他有其他选择吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:29	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：他绝对有 除此之外的多种选择， 我认为 作为一名歇发者 实际上伤害正当的揭秘活动。 如果一个为美国国家安全局工作的人， 我们有超过 35000 名雇员。 他们都是好公民。 他们只是普通人， 像是你的丈夫，父亲，姐妹们， 兄弟，邻居，侄子，朋友，亲戚， 他们都致力于 为国家 和我们在国际上的盟友效力， 如果工作人员遇到一些困扰 有很多方式可以解决。 首先，他们有上司， 并且通过监管链向上 在他们的组织内部。 如果工作人员对这样的方式 感到不满意， 我们有许多监察人员 可以帮助处理问题。 就斯诺登先生的问题而言， 他可以寻求 美国国家安全局监察长， 海军总监察长， 太平洋司令部监察长， 国防部门监察长， 和情报系统监察长， 他们中的任何一位都会 将这样的问题归类 并且乐于帮助解决。 （CA 和 RL 同时讲话） 他可以选择去国会， 是有解决机制的， 然而他没有寻求 上述任何一种方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:54	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：你刚刚说到， 斯诺登有其他的途径 来寻求解决他的问题。 主要有这样几件事情： 首先，他肯定认为， 作为一名合同工， 原本可以追溯的途径 却由于他是雇员而是不可用的， 第二，其他揭发者的记录， 像是 [托马斯 安德鲁斯 德雷克] 很多人认为， 受到了不好的对待， 第三，就他所看到的问题 并不是一种具体的缺陷， 而是，这样的程序已全被 三个政府部门批准了。 我的意思是，在这种情况下， 你认为他做的事情 是否合理？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:40	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 不，我不同意。 我认为 ― ― 对不起，我听到 那里的麦克风有些噪音 ― ― 他的行动是不适当的， 因为他给人们的生活带来风险， 基本上，从长远来看， 我知道在公共场合 斯诺登先生和一些记者 说已披露的事情 没有给国家安全和人民带来风险， 这绝对不是真实的。 事实上是有风险的。 我认为他令人惊异地骄傲自大， 仿佛他比制宪者 知道更多 有关政府该 如何治理与分权。 事实上，行政部门和立法部门 合作同时也彼此制衡， 还有司法部门 负责监督整个过程。 我认为他这样的想法是 非常傲慢自大的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:54	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 请给出一个具体的例子好吗？ 有关他是如何将人们置于危险中的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:59	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：好，没问题。 他已透露的情报， 国安局的能力， 和美国国家安全局是一个 基于能力的组织， 因此，当我们有境外情报目标， 合法的感兴趣的事 ― ― 恐怖分子是个标志性的例子， 但它也包括了像是贩卖人口， 贩卖毒品， 建造先进武器， 核武器的人， 为其提供运输途径的人， 那些可能侵犯其近邻的国家， 当发现这样的情况 和正在发生的这样的情况， 我们要让能力得到 分散的，指挥的，受控制的运用。 因此，不受约束地披露这样的能力 就意味着，对手会得到讯息 并意识到，"嘿，我有这个弱点，" 他们就会避开， 我们看到恐怖主义的目标， 在民族国家范围， 在各种走私方式， 有些人，得益于这样的能力披露， 得以逃脱我们的视线， 我们很难得到 有关他们行踪的情报。 这样产生的效应是 我们在海外危险地区的工作人员， 无论他们是外交或是军事人员， 还有我们处于同样境地的盟友， 处于更大的风险中， 因为我们无法知晓 即将到来的对他们的威胁。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:25	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 总的来说，你的回应是 由于他的揭露行为， 你对某些信息的接触管道 被关闭了。 但关注点是，这种接触的性质 首先就不需要是合法的。 我的意思是，请给我们描述一下 这个布尔溪程序， 它宣称美国国家安全局 为了得到你所说的 那种信息的接触管道 是削弱了我们的安全的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:54	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：是的，当我们 有我之前描述过的类型的 合法的外国情报目标， 使用全球电信系统 作为他们的通信方式， 他们这样做是因为 这是一个很棒的系统， 它是人类所能设计出来的 最复杂的系统， 它是一个奇迹， 很多工作人员在房间里 负责创造 和增强其应用 它是很好的系统。 但是用他的人也包括那些 对抗我们和我们盟友的人。 因此，如果我们要去追击他们， 就需要具备这样那样的能力 去找到他们， 再重申一次，将控件的 我该如何运用这种能力， 不是我本身所拥有的能力。 不然，如果我们能这样做 所有使用互联网的坏人 我们可以有个域名，badguy.com。 这会很棒， 我们可以把所有的心血专注于此。 可惜并不是这样。 他们试图 躲避政府 隔离并阻截他们的能力， 所以我们必须在 同一空间内活动。 我要说的是， 美国国家安全局有两个任务。 一是的信号情报任务 很遗憾，我们从媒体上读到了很多。 另一个是信息安全保障任务， 这是为了保护美国的国家安全系统， 我们所保护的通信包括下列这些 美国总统的通信往来， 管理核武器的通信， 我们世界范围内的军事通信， 我们与盟友共同使用的通信， 盟友间的通信。 所以我们提出 使用标准的建议， 我们也使用相同的标准， 我们投入 以确保使这些通信 是安全的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:42	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 你的意思是， 以互联网整体来看， 任何战略都是公平的游戏 只要它提高了美国的安全水平。 我想这就是出现 不同观点的部分， 很多人，包括这个房间里 和世界各地的人们 对互联网有不同看法。 他们认为互联网是重大的 人类发明， 可以与古腾堡印刷机相提并论。 它是人类知识的使者。 它是一切的连接器。 从那些有点理想主义的角度来看。 从那个角度看来， 美国国家安全局做的事相当于 德国当局 在每个印刷机里装上设备 了解人们买了哪些书 和他们所阅读的内容。 从这样的观点看来， 国安局的行为有些粗暴？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:37	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 我明白并且同意互联网的功能， 我想说它比互联网更大。 它是一个全球电信系统。 互联网是其中的一个大块， 但还有更多。 我认为人们有正当理由关注 透明度和秘密的平衡。 这种表达也指 隐私和国家安全间的平衡。 这不认为这是正确的框架。 我认为它真的是透明且保密的。 我们正在讨论的 有关国家和国际的对话， 和我们想要参加其中， 希望人们了解。 所以有些事情， 让我扩展一下， 有件事情是需要保持透明的： 我们的当局，我们的流程， 我们的监督，我们是谁。 我们，美国国家安全局， 在这方面做得不够好， 我认为其中的原因 已经被媒体揭示 并引起轰动。 没人知道我们是谁。 我们是“没听过的机构”，“沉默的机构”。 我们标志里的老鹰起飞了 这只鹰还带着耳机。 这就是公共属性。 因此我们需要将这些事情透明化。 我们不需要保持透明的是 那些对美国来说不利的事情， 那些对与我们有合作的 接受我们信息的国家不利 这会帮助他们保护自己 以及人民的安全， 公开运作和能力是不利的行为 如果这样做将会使得那些 我们反对的人， 一般公认的坏人们， 能够有办法对付我们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:19	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森: 但是， 是不是也不好应对 惨败的美国公司 这些公司提供了世界上 大部分的互联网服务？ 理查德 莱杰特：是的。 确实这些公司都处于 一个艰难的位置，如同我们， 因为是我们 强迫这些公司提供信息， 就像在世界的每个其他国家一样。 世界上的每个工业化国家 都有一套合法截取信息的程序 他们要求公司 为他们提供用以保障安全 的信息， 这次事件所涉及的公司 都遵从这些程序 他们也要从事同样的活动 当营运在俄罗斯或英国 或中国或印度或法国， 你能说出的任何国家。 这些揭示 被广泛地描绘成 "你不能信任A公司，因为 您的隐私是不受他们保护的" 在某种意义上这是准确的 世界上的任何其他公司 在处理与任何国家间关系的时候。 这被人们用来 作为一个市场营销策略， 几个国家都在推销着 包括一些与我们联盟的国家， 他们说， “嘿，你不能信任美国， 但你可以信赖我们的通信公司， 因为我们保障用户的安全。” 实际上他们在用这个营销策略 来与美国的公司竞争 美国公司在云技术和 基于互联网的技术领域 有很大的技术优势。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:57	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 你身后有美国国旗， 美国宪法保障了公民的 不遭受不合理的搜查和扣押的自由。 你是如何描述 美国公民隐私权的？ 有这样的一种权利吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:15	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 是的，当然有。 我们投入大量的时间和精力， 我是指，过度却又适当的， 时间和努力，以确保 我们保护公民隐私。 我们也保护， 不只是美国人，而是 世界各地公民的隐私权。 可以用几件事情来论述这点。 第一，我们都使用同一个网络。 我的通讯， 我是某个电子邮件公司的用户 这个是全球恐怖分子 首选的公司。 在互联网中，我的邮件账户就在 他们的电子邮件账户隔壁。 因此我们需要把这些信息拆分， 找出相关的信息。 要这样做，一定会遇到 美国人和无辜的外国公民 那些只是在忙各自事物的人。 因此，我们有操作程序 将那些事情分别出来， 也就是说，当你发现它， 不是如果你发现它，而是当你找到它， 因为你无法避免会发现它 这是你如何保护它的程序。 这些被称为，最小化程序。 他们是由联邦司法部批准 并且是基于宪法规定的。 于是，我们保护这样的信息。 对人们来说，世界上的公民 那些在处理其合法的业务 日常工作的， 总统在他1月17日的演讲中提到， 会有额外的保护措施 能提供给他们。 所以我绝对认为， 人们是有隐私权的， 我们非常努力工作以确保 这样的隐私权受到保护。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:51	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：那么当外国人使用 美国公司的互联网服务 他们有任何隐私权吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:58	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 他们有。 他们有，从某种意义上说， 只有这样，我们才能够强迫 某一家公司为我们提供信息 是当他属于下列 三个类别之一的情况下： 我们可以确定，这个特定的人， 被挑选出来认为 与反恐怖主义或者 核扩散或其他境外情报目标。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:27	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 事实上， 你们已经通过这些计划 获得了很多信息， 本质上是元数据。 它不一定是实际的语词， 像是某人电子邮件中写的内容 或是一通电话里说的话。 而是收件方是谁，什么时候写的，等等。 但有人一直认为， 这座观众中有人与 前美国国家安全局分析师交谈过 那位分析师说 元数据实际上 比核心数据更具有攻击性， 因为在核心数据 你表现出的是你希望展现的样子。 而元数据，谁知道会被得出 怎样的结论？ 是这样吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:03	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 我不是很明白这一论点。 我认为元数据的重要性 有下列几个原因。 元数据可以让你找到 人们试图隐藏的关系。 因此当一名恐怖分子在回应 某个我们不知道的人， 而这人从事或支持恐怖活动， 这人或许违反了国际制裁 提供与核武器相关的材料 给伊朗或朝鲜这样的国家， 正试图隐藏这种活动， 因为它是非法的。 元数据在这种时候就能帮你 连接这些资讯。 供替代的做法 是一种效率较低的 并且更加侵犯隐私权的方式， 那将是数量庞大的内容集合。 因此元数据，在这个意义上， 其实是加强隐私的。 我们不像报道中 所说的那样， 我们不会坐在那里 查看普罗大众的元数据文件。 如果你没有与那些 有根据的情报目标有联系， 我们对你并不感兴趣。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:07	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：总地来说 以美国所面临的威胁， 你认为恐怖主义的重要性在哪个位置? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:15	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 我认为 恐怖主义仍是第一位的。 我们从来没有过在一段时间内 有越来越多的地方 事情变得越来越糟糕， 恐怖分子利用政府的治理漏洞 来制造恐怖活动培养皿。 我的老领导，汤姆・法戈，法戈上将， 用不稳定的弧线描述它。 当今世界上，有很多 这样不稳定的因素， 在叙利亚，正在进行一次内战 你会得到大量的数字， 成千上万的外国武装分子 正在前往叙利亚 去了解如何成为恐怖分子 实践恐怖活动， 那些人中的很多是西方人 持有欧洲国家的护照 或在某些情况下，美国护照， 他们去学习如何参与圣战， 表达了走出去 以后在自己的国家实践 这样的意图。 像伊拉克这样的地方 遭受着更高水平的宗派暴力事件， 于是再一次成为 恐怖主义的滋生地。 一些活动发生在非洲之角 和非洲的萨赫勒地区。 再次，许多政府治理的薄弱性 造就了恐怖活动的温床。 因此我认为这是非常严重的。 我认为它是我国面临的首要威胁。 第二个是网络安全威胁。 我认为网络是安全威胁 表现在三个方面： 方式一，也是人们听说过 最常见的方式， 是盗窃知识产权， 基本上，外国进入网络， 窃取公司机密， 然后将该信息 提供给国有企业 或是与政府有关系的公司 以帮助他们跨越技术的鸿沟 或者是获得商业情报 用于赢得境外合同。 这是一套非常昂贵的活动。 几个民族国家正在进行这样的活动。 第二是阻绝服务攻击。 你可能注意到自2012年起 已经出现一连串针对 美国金融业的攻击。 再次，执行这些攻击的，是某一个国家， 他们一直在这样做， 作为一种半匿名式的报复。 最后一个是破坏性的攻击， 这是我最担心的。 这些行动有上升的趋势。 在2012年有针对 沙特阿美石油公司的攻击， 那是在2012年的8月。 大约35,000台电脑遭到 雨刷风格的病毒攻击。 一周后延续到 一家卡塔尔公司。 在2013年3月， 一场针对韩国的攻击， 新闻界将其归功于朝鲜， 当时数千台计算机遭到攻击。 这些行动出现的频率正在上升， 我们感到人们正在 对这样的行为表示兴趣 并且有实施这一行为的愿望。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:10	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：一些事情， 因为这几乎是真正的核心部分。 我的意思是，首先， 很多人看到风险 再看到数字 不明白仍将恐怖主义 视为头号威胁的原因。 除了911事件之外， 数据表明在过去的 30年或40年间 美国约有500人死于恐怖主义， 绝大多数死于本土恐怖分子手中。 在过去的几年中 死于恐怖主义的几率 是远小于被雷电击中的几率的。 我猜你会解释说某一起核事故 或生化恐怖主义行为或类似的事情 就能改变这些数字。 是这样吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:51	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特： 好吧， 我主要说两件事。 其中一个就是， 美国自9/11以来 并未遭受重大的恐怖袭击 不是偶然的。 因为我们很努力地工作， 那些在情报系统 任职的工作人员的工作成果， 那些军队的工作成果， 和我们全球各地的盟友的工作成果。 那些数字 只是冰山一角， 美国国家安全局项目 成功阻止了54场恐怖袭击， 25起在欧洲， 那25起中的， 18起出现在三个国家， 其中包括我们的盟友， 顺便说一下，其中有些打败了 美国国家安全局的程序。 因此，那些事情发生不是偶然的。 是辛苦工作的成果。 我们寻找 关于恐怖活动的情报 通过这样那样的方式封锁他们， 通过诉诸法律， 通过与其他国家通力合作 有时候会采取军事行动。 我想说的另一件事是 有关核武器或生化武器的想法 绝不牵强， 确实有一些团体 常年保有希望获得 这样能力的兴趣， 并且已经在付诸行动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:05	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：也有人说， 那54起的指控， 和斯诺登先生透露的 饱受争议的项目 之间的联系 趋拘于零， 那是通过其他形式的情报工作， 如同你在干草堆中寻找一根针， 这些项目的影响 这些有争议的项目， 只是往干草堆中添加干草， 而非找到那根针。 针是通过其他方式发现的。 请问你要如何回应？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:37	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：不，实际上两个程序 涉及到这方面的讨论。 一是章节215项目， 美国电话系统元数据的程序， 另一个是 俗称的棱镜门程序， 它是外国情报监听法 修正案第702条。 但是215程序 只与直接针对美国的 行动有关， 受此牵连的 有十几个威胁。 现在你会看到人们公开说 是有没有"，但却"的情况下， 所以有没有什么地方，但为此， 威胁将会发生。 但是，实际上表明了一种无知， 人们不了解调查恐怖分子 的工作是如何完成的。 你想到在电视上， 看到一个神秘的谋杀。 你是如何开始？开始于一个人， 他们解决犯罪。 实际上我们在那之前就开始工作了， 希望在任何机构前工作, 我们试图建立档案 这些人是谁，他们想做些什么， 这就涉及到大量的信息。 把它想作是马赛克， 很难说，马赛克中任何一片 对建筑马赛克至关重要， 但是为了建立完整的图片， 你需要有所有的信息片段。 另一方面，那54起 并非与美国相关的威胁 其中的42件， 棱镜项目与其非常相关， 事实上是在提供材料 以阻止这些攻击。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:09:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：斯诺登两天前说 恐怖主义一直 在情报系统称之为 "行动的幌子"， 这是重要的， 因为它会调动人们 强大的情绪反应， 它允许这些程序启动， 让像你们这样的机构本拥有 本不该有的权利。 关于这个话题你们有内部辩论吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:34:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：是的。 我的意思是，我们时常 在辩论这些问题， 在行政部门还有 持续不断的讨论 在美国国家安全局内部 和情报系统 关于什么是正确的，什么是相称的， 什么是正确的事情。 重点提一下这些 我们正在谈论的项目 是被两个不同的总统授权的， 两个不同的政党， 两次经手国会， 由联邦法官16次不同时间， 所以这不是美国国家安全局 自编自导自演的。 这是一项合法的活动， 让美国国外政府， 美国政府的 所有分支， 和麦迪逊总统感到自豪。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:21:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：然而， 当国会议员们发现 在授权情况下实际上的行为， 他们中的很多都完全惊呆了。 或者，你认为那不是一个合理的反应， 它是因为公开在民众眼前， 他们才真的知道你们在做什么 在他们授予的权力之下？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:41:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：国会是一个巨大的组织， 国会议员有535名， 人员经常变动， 众议院每隔两年变动， 我认为美国国家安全局提供了 监督委员会所需的所有相关信息， 然后这些信息的传播 通过整个国会监督委员会 是他们管理的东西。 我会说，国会议员 有机会让自己意识到这些， 事实上他们中的大多数， 那些被分配有监督责任的人 没有能力做到这一点。 委员会主席在公共场合说过多次。 克里斯 安德森：你所提到 网络攻击的威胁 我认为在场所有人都同意 这是一个巨大的关注点， 但你是否认为有个权衡点 在进攻性和防御性战略之间， 和它是可能，而采取的非常措施 以"削弱加密" 允许你自己找到的坏家伙， 可能还敞开一扇门招致网络攻击吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:44:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：我想说两件事情。 一是你说的削弱加密。我没有。 那是另一个 美国国家安全局 同时具有这些特派团， 我们都严重偏向于防御， 实际上，我们发现的漏洞 在绝大多数情况下， 我们向那些负责任的人披露 那些人负责制造或开发这些产品。 我们有记录， 我们实际上正在建议 要透明，透明度报告发布 与互联网公司同样 都允许发布透明度报告。 我们想要变得更加透明。 同样的我们吃我们自己的狗食。 我们使用同样的标准， 我们使用同样的产品 我们建议， 所以这是我们的利益所在 以保护我们的通信 以其他人所需要的同样的方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:44:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华 斯诺登 在他的谈话之后通过机器人 在这里徘徊， 我听到几个人 问他对于美国国安局 总的看法， 他对那些与你共事的人 称赞有加， 他说这些是 充满干劲的员工， 这些员工在做正确的事， 而问题只是来自于 错误构想的政策。 他的表现非常合理并且冷静。 他不是个疯子。 你会接受这样的看法吗， 即使你不同意他的作法， 但他开启了一场重要辩论？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:33:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：我认为， 讨论是重要的。 我不喜欢他那样的处理方式。 我认为有多种其他的方法 可供选择， 那些方法不会危及我们的人民 和其他国家的人民， 失去看到我们对手 在做什么的能力。 但我认为它是一个重要的谈话。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:58:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：报道称 你和你的同事们 有着几乎不同的意见 在何种情况下， 他可能会提出大赦协议。 我想，你的老板， 基思 亚历山大将军， 说过这这将是一个对他人的 糟糕示范； 你不能与那些已经 已经触犯了法律的人商谈。 但你曾说过， 如果斯诺登交出 所有未披露的文件， 这样的交易也许应该可以考虑。 你仍然这样认为吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:30:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：是的，实际上， 这是我最喜欢的《60分钟》 采访， 一切都是值得。 我在回答如下问题， 你愿意包容 有关减轻对斯诺登采取行动的讨论吗？ 我说是的， 它是值得的一次谈话。 这些事情美国的司法部长 和总统都 谈到过这样的问题， 我遵从司法部长， 因为这是他的领域。 但是美国法律界 较强的传统是 与那些被控有罪 但可能对政府有益的人 进行交谈协商， 以得到一些东西， 总会有这种讨论的余地。 所以我不会假设任何结果， 但总是会有讨论的空间。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:21:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：在非专业人士看来 他有一些东西可以提供给美国， 政府，你，其他人， 以纠正错误 并帮助找出一个更优异的政策， 和走向未来的好方法。 你认为这种可能性 会被包容吗？ 理查德 莱杰特：这已超出我领域。 这不是一个美国国家安全局的事情。 这将是司法部的 研究讨论。 我会听从他们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:53:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：理查德， 当斯诺登结束讲话的时候， 我请他分享 值得传播的想法。 你值得传播的想法 是什么呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:04:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：我认为是，了解事实。 这是一个非常重要的谈话， 它的影响涉及极广， 不只是有关于美国国家安全局， 不是只有关于政府， 它有关于你，它有关于互联网公司。 隐私和个人数据的问题 比政府多得多， 所以了解事实。 不要依赖头条新闻， 不要依赖于大众评论， 不要依赖于片面的看法。 这就是我认为，值得推广的想法。 我们有一个标志， 一个徽章， 我们在工作时 用挂袋佩戴徽章， 如果我能制作一个插头， 证件挂绳上写着， "达拉斯牛仔队"。 去达拉斯。 我已经疏远了一半的观众，我知道。 所以我们员工 那些在工作中 处理密码分析的员工 有一个挂绳标签， 写着“看看这些数据”。 这就是值得传播的思想。 看看数据。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:00:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：理查德， 这需要很大的勇气， 我认为，来到这里 公开演讲。 这不只关于美国国家安全局 过去的工作成就， 这也涉及了对技术水平的挑战。 我们真的很感激你来到这里 与我们大家共享非常重要的演说。 非常感谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:18:00	<br><br>
	
理查德 莱杰特：谢谢你，克里斯。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:20:00	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives ― and the laws that protect it. "Your rights matter,” he says, "because you never know when you're going to need them." Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee. 	<br><br>
	
 Edward Snowden	<br><br>
	
  Mar 2014 	<br><br>
	
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens, the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations, Ed Snowden. (Applause) Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop, so he can see what the bot can see. Ed, welcome to the TED stage. What can you see, as a matter of fact? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:44	<br><br>
	
Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone. This is amazing. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor, a hero. What words would you describe yourself with? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
ES: You know, everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it, this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world, you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want, the kind of Internet we want, the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards, and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself, I wouldn't use words like "hero." I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor." I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen, just like everyone else. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
CA: So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story -- (Applause) ― this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin, you had access to their systems, and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now, what propelled you to do this? ES: You know, when I was sitting in Hawaii, and the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community, I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community, things that need to be done, and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done, and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness, without the public's consent, and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues, I thought to myself, how can I do this in the most responsible way, that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks? And out of all the solutions that I could come up with, out of going to Congress, when there were no laws, there were no legal protections for a private employee, a contractor in intelligence like myself, there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason, and that's to enable an adversarial press, to challenge the government, but also to work together with the government, to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists, by giving all of my information back to the American people, rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication, we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened, the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm, and because of that, I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:45	<br><br>
	
CA: So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up, and Ed, I don't know whether you can see, the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program, and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:02	<br><br>
	
ES: The best way to understand PRISM, because there's been a little bit of controversy, is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata, and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section 215 of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping, mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records, things like that -- who you're talking to, when you're talking to them, where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America, it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist, even though some of them -- I believe Yahoo was one of them ― challenged them in court, they all lost, because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen, something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is, there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said 15 federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful, but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered 34,000 warrant requests over 33 years, and in 33 years only rejected 11 government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies, Internet companies, are alleged to have joined the program, and where data collection began from them. Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:09	<br><br>
	
ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst, someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers, things like that, in Hawaii, is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back-room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is, when we talk about how this information is given, it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here: even though companies pushed back, even though companies demanded, hey, let's do this through a warrant process, let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review, some sort of basis for handing over these users' data, we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA, the NSA isn't satisfied with that, and because of that, we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user, and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year, we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that, and I encourage them to continue. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
CA: What more should they do? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:01	<br><br>
	
ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today, right now, without consulting with lawyers, to protect the rights of users worldwide, is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today, if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com, the NSA can see a record of that, the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that, the Chinese service can see a record of that, the French service, the German service, the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com, but not only do they not support encryption by default, you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change, not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out, but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:12	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause) This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:22	<br><br>
	
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress, was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said, we don't track those stats, and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world, because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them, but the reality, when you look at this slide is, not only do they have the capability, the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication, and if it says, this communication came from America, they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today, right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:43	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post, again from your data. The headline says, "NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year." Tell us about that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
ES: We also heard in Congressional testimony last year, it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents, knows what's in them, to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses, that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules, when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this, about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules, their own laws thousands of times in a single year, including one event by itself, one event out of those 2,776, that affected more than 3,000 people. In another event, they intercepted all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident. What's amazing about this, this report, that didn't get that much attention, is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it, but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:20	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this: Why should we care about all this surveillance, honestly? I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view? ES: Well, so the first thing is, you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey, you know, I don't think I'm going to need them, so I'm just going to trust that, you know, let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter, these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity, not just in America, but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family, people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones, people should be able to buy a book online, they should be able to travel by train, they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government, possibly not even your government years in the future, how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody, any government authority, with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
CA: Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite, Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
ES: Dick Cheney's really something else. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. (Laughter) I think it's amazing, because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work, Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide, the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off, and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe, and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses, Chinese businesses, and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together, and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards, the security, the manner of behavior, that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:13	<br><br>
	
CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen 1.7 million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:27	<br><br>
	
ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:41	<br><br>
	
CA: Come here, because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called "Bullrun." Can you explain what that is? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:01	<br><br>
	
ES: So Bullrun, and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor, this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill, which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey, we need to work with you to secure your systems, but in reality, they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit, but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous, because if we lose a single standard, if we lose the trust of something like SSL, which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program, we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:27	<br><br>
	
CA: And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:38	<br><br>
	
ES: Absolutely. One of the problems, one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post-9/11 era, is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations, that is hacking, but they've also been in charge of defensive operations, and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets, if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets, that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications, they're not only putting the world at risk, they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way, because intellectual property is the basis, the foundation of our economy, and if we put that at risk through weak security, we're going to be paying for it for years. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:40	<br><br>
	
CA: But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:50	<br><br>
	
ES: Well, when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism, you will see that that's unfounded, and you don't have to take my word for it, because we've had the first open court, the first federal court that's reviewed this, outside the secrecy arrangement, called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress, who has access to be briefed on these things, and now has the desire to be, has produced bills to reform it, and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping? Do these programs have any value at all? I say no, and all three branches of the American government say no as well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:48	<br><br>
	
CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:53	<br><br>
	
ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:55	<br><br>
	
CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
22:01	<br><br>
	
ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs, the NSA asked for these authorities back in the 1990s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era, they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress, without asking the American people, and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against, because it makes us less safe, and it offers no value. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:03	<br><br>
	
CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec, because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror, most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened, what the treatment that Bradley Manning got, Chelsea Manning as now is, and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this? How are you coping with the fear? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:36	<br><br>
	
ES: It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government, but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process, they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial, these are things that we need to work against as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end, I'm happy to do despite the risks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
24:32:00	<br><br>
	
CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here, because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices, right? You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long-term good? Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those, that this was a reckless act? There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here, but I see them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:15:00	<br><br>
	
ES: I can see you. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:18:00	<br><br>
	
CA: And who goes with the second choice, the fundamentally heroic act? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:22:00	<br><br>
	
(Applause) (Cheers) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:25:00	<br><br>
	
And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through, because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right, it's not really about pro-government, libertarian, or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:02:00	<br><br>
	
ES: It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms, and when I say our, I don't just mean Americans, I mean people around the world, it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe, and it's up to all of us to protect them, and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet, it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy, and if we don't change things, if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe, not just for us but for everyone, we're going to lose that, and that would be a tremendous loss, not just for us, but for the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:49:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web, who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say, do we have a microphone for Tim? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:02:00	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:04:00	<br><br>
	
Tim, good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in, by the way, traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but -- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:17:00	<br><br>
	
Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer answers to that question, but hero, if I have to make the choice between the two. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:26:00	<br><br>
	
CA: And Ed, I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense? ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up not just thinking about the Internet, but I grew up in the Internet, and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual, almost avatar manner, I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet, and it's something that I hope, I invite everyone in the audience, not just here in Vancouver but around the world, to join and participate in. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:34:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Do you have a question for Ed? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:36:00	<br><br>
	
TBL: Well, two questions, a general question ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:39:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, can you still hear us? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:41:00	<br><br>
	
ES: Yes, I can hear you. CA: Oh, he's back. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:45:00	<br><br>
	
TBL: The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:50:00	<br><br>
	
ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:52:00	<br><br>
	
TBL: So, from the 25 years, stepping back and thinking, what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:08:00	<br><br>
	
ES: When we think about in terms of how far we can go, I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need, and by cooperating, by engaging not just the technical parts of society, but as you said, the users, the people around the world who contribute through the Internet, through social media, who just check the weather, who rely on it every day as a part of their life, to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had, but a better Internet, a better now, something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:06:00	<br><br>
	
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984. A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We, through the power of the web, and transparency, are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view, but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:36:00	<br><br>
	
ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle, which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude, and each time that occurs, we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now, that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude, and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today, but there is still hope, because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win, and I think that's something that we need to take hope from, and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime, communication is not a crime, and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:58:00	<br><br>
	
CA: I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot, but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. TBL: That'll come very soon. ES: Nice to meet you, and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:12:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Thank you, Tim. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:15:00	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:20:00	<br><br>
	
I mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:29:00	<br><br>
	
ES: Absolutely. There's really no question, the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world, and I think if the press is now saying, we support this, this is something that needed to happen, that's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument, and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time, the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal, that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working, to come back, and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right, and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:35:00	<br><br>
	
CA: In the meantime, courtesy of the Internet and this technology, you're here, back in North America, not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form. I'm curious, how does that feel? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:51:00	<br><br>
	
ES: Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:01:00	<br><br>
	
CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading." If you could encapsulate it in a single idea, what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment? ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors, but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors, and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives, and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:46:00	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:47:00	<br><br>
	
CA: Ed, thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:49:00	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：公民的权利， 互联网的未来。 让我们欢迎， 将这一切公诸于世的人 来到 TED 的讲台， 爱德华 斯诺登 （鼓掌） 爱德华位于遥远的俄罗斯某处 他通过笔记本电脑 操控这个网络机器人， 他能看到这个网络机器人 能看到的一切。 爱德华，欢迎来到TED。 事实上，你都能看到些什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:44	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 哈，我能看到每一个人。 这太酷了。 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华， 我想问你一些问题。 在过去的几个月里 人们给予你多种称谓。 你被称作是告密者、卖国贼、 英雄。 你会用怎样的字眼来形容自己？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：那些卷入 这场争论的人 都纠结于我是谁， 我有怎样的性格 以及要如何描述我。 但当我想说， 我们不该纠结于这些问题。 我是谁，这真的不重要。 如果我是世界上最坏的人， 你可以恨我， 然后继续你的生活。 真正重要的是这些问题。 真正重要的是， 我们想要怎样的政府， 我们想要怎样的互联网， 我们想要怎样的 人与社会关系。 这些才是我所希望的讨论方向， 我们也看到， 有更多讨论正在进行中。 如果我要形容我自己， 我并不会用“英雄”这样的字眼。 我不是“爱国者”， 亦不是“叛国贼”。 我是一个美国人， 是一个公民， 就和大家一样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：现在为那些 不了解完整事件的人介绍一下―― （鼓掌）―― 一年前，你驻扎在夏威夷 作为美国国家安全局的顾问。 作为系统管理员，你可以 进入他们的系统， 然后你开始将所获取的机密文件 发给你精心挑选的记者们， 随之而然，发生了 六月份的揭秘事件。 是什么使你有做这件事的动力呢？ 爱德华 斯诺登：你知道吗， 当我在夏威夷的时候， 和之前的一年， 那时我在情报系统工作， 我看到很多令我不安的事。 在情报系统， 我们做很多有益的事， 那些需要被完成的事， 那些可以帮助人们的事。 但是，有些事做得过头了。 不应该做那些事， 那些秘密做出的决定， 是在公众无意识到的情况下， 在公众未允许的情况下， 在甚至于政府内的代表 都不知道的情况下。 当我和这些事物斗争的时候， 我想， 要如何以最可靠地方式完成， 最大化公众利益 同时将风险最小化？ 在我所能想到的所有解决方案 除了去国会， 当没有法律 也没有针对私人雇员的 合法保护的情况下， 像我这样在情报系统工作的合约人员， 存在着我会和情报一起消失 而公众永远都会被蒙在鼓里的风险。 但是美国宪法的第一条修正案 保证了我们的新闻自由， 这确保了有站在对立面的媒体， 来挑战政府， 但同时和政府合作， 进行对话，讨论我们要如何 将重要信息传达给公众 而不会将我们的国家安全置于危险中。 通过和记者合作， 通过将所有我搜集到的信息 还给美国人民， 而不是相信我自己来 做出有关于出版的决定， 我们有过一场热烈辩论 有关政府的一项深入投资, 我想这是对每个人都是有益的。 而政府恐吓的所谓风险， 政府宣扬的 所谓风险 从未成为现实。 我们没见到任何一个 具体伤害案例的证据 正因为这样 我对自己做出的决定感到合理。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:45	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 让我展示给观众 你揭示的一些文件作为例子。 我们向前翻一页，爱德华， 我不知道你能不能看到 这里展示的幻灯片。 这个幻灯片展示的 是棱镜门项目， 也许你可以告诉观众 你揭示的是什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:02	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 了解棱镜门最好的方式， 因为存在些许论战， 就是来谈论棱镜门不是什么。 美国的很多争辩有关元数据。 他们说这只是 有关元数据，仅此而已， 他们谈论一个特殊的法定权利， 即爱国者法案的第215章节。 这个章节允许未经授权的窃听行为， 大面积监察整个国家的 电话记录，还有如下的事―― 你在和谁说话， 你什么时候和他们说话， 你去了哪里旅游。 这都是元数据事件。 棱镜门与内容息息相关。 通过这个项目政府能够 强迫美国的企业 能够代理美国企业 来为美国国家安全局做卑鄙的工作。 即使很多这些公司做出了抵抗， 即使这其中很多公司―― 我相信雅虎是其中一个―― 在法庭上做出了挑战， 但他们都失败了， 因为这一切辩论从不是 在公开法庭进行的。 而是只在秘密法庭中进行。 那些我们看到的事情， 那些棱镜门项目中 对我来说感到非常担忧的是， 美国政府的其中一条论据是 他们说15名联邦法院法官 审查过这些项目 并且认为这是合法的， 但他们没有告诉你的是 那些是秘密法官 在秘密法庭 基于对于法律的秘密解读， 在33年内共收到 34000件认证请求， 并且在33年内，仅拒绝了 11项政府请求。 我们不希望也不需要这些人来 决定美国在一个 自由开放的网路社会 所要扮演怎样的角色。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 现在，这张幻灯片 展示了 各个科技公司，互联网企业， 被指加入此项目的日期， 也就是从这些日期起， 这些公司经手的数据被搜集起来。 此时，它们否认了 与美国国家安全局有合作关系。 这些数据是如何 被美国国家安全局收集的呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:09	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登: 有关美国国家安全局的这些页面 指的是其对信息的直接涉入。 这对于一个真正的国安局分析师意味着， 像我这样从事情报分析的工作人员， 追踪，中国的网络骇客， 这类的工作，在夏威夷， 这些数据的出处 是直接来自他们的服务器的。 这并不是说 有一批各个公司的代表 坐在烟雾缭绕的房间里， 在国安局打得火热， 从事密室交易 探讨他们如何出卖这些数据。 每个公司都有不同的处理方式。 有些公司很负责任。 有些就不那么负责了。 但主要原t是，当我们讨论到 这些信息是如何提交给国安局， 是这些公司自己提供的。 并不是遭到窃取。 但有一点值得注意的是： 即使这些公司退回国安局的提案， 即使这些公司询问， 嘿，我们可以通过 正当的渠道做这些事， 我们这样处理 我们确实有一些法律审查， 一些类似移交 用户数据的基本条例， 我们看到华盛顿邮报去年的报道， 尽管没有像棱镜门事件这样详细， 其报道称，国家安全局闯入 谷歌的数据中心 将其连接入自己的数据库， 同时遭涉入的还有雅虎。 即使这些公司 至少是在被强迫， 但还是考量到法律因素的状况下 与国安局进行合作， 国安局仍对此不甚满意， 因为这样，我们需要这些公司 能够更加努力 来保证他们将会代表 用户的利益，并且 为用户的权益发声。 我认为，在过去的一年， 我们看到这些在棱镜门中 被点名的公司 做出巨大的努力， 我鼓励他们继续斗争。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：你认为他们 还需要做哪些进一步的工作呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:01	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 此时此刻，美国的网络公司 可以做的是， 无须与律师咨询， 保障全球范围内用户的权利， 在用户造访的每个网页 开启加密套接字协议层。 其重要的原因在于， 如果你在亚马逊网站上看1984 （译者注：英国作家乔治 奥威尔的著作）， 国安局可以看到这份浏览记录， 俄罗斯的情报机构 可以看到这份浏览记录， 中国的情报机关也能看到这份浏览记录， 法国的情报机构，德国的情报机构， 安道尔共和国的情报机构也能看到。 这些机构都能看到这份浏览记录， 因为它没有被加密保护起来。 亚马逊网站是世界图书馆， 但亚马逊既没有默认支持加密保护， 用户个人在浏览书籍的时候， 也无法选择使用加密保护。 我们需要改变， 不只是亚马逊， 我并不是想针对它， 但不得不说，它是个好例子。 所有的公司需要 默认加密保护 所有用户的浏览记录， 保护那些没有安装任何加密措施 或没有设置特殊选择的用户。 这将会加强隐私保护和 全球人民所应当享有的权利。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:12	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华， 跟我一起来到舞台的这边， 我想展示下一张幻灯片。（鼓掌） 这个项目名叫“无限线人”。 那是什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:22	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 我想要感谢国安局 为它们自己的这个项目 起了合适的名字。 这是我最喜欢的国安局假名。 “无限线人” 是国安局隐瞒国会的一个项目。 之前，国会曾问过国家安全局， 有没有任何方法 能够给一个大概的估算， 估算出美国的通讯 有多少是被窃听的。 他们说没有。他们说， 我们不会追踪那些数据， 并且我们也不能 追踪那些数据。 我们无法告诉你们， 我们在全球范围内 正在窃听多少通讯资料， 因为如果告知你们的这个行为 是侵犯你们隐私的。 现在，我非常感谢他们的节操， 但现实是，你看到的这张幻灯片， 不仅说明了他们有这样的能力， 这样的能力早已存在了。 已经在实施了。 国安局有自己的内部数据格式， 能够追踪通讯的两端， 如果显示， 通讯是源自美国本土的， 他们可以告知国会， 有多少通讯信息 此时此刻在他们掌握之中。 “无限线人”这个项目告诉我们， 被国安局窃听的通讯信息， 多发生在美国本土， 就在美国人民之间。 比窃听到的在俄罗斯的 俄罗斯人的通讯情报要多。 我不认为情报机关 应该以窃听本土民众通讯为目标。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:43	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华， 华盛顿邮报又爆出了新的故事， 还是从你提供的数据。 其标题称， “美国国家安全局每年 违反隐私条例数千次。” 请谈一谈你的观点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 去年的国会证言也提到过， 这太令人吃惊了， 像我这样为国安局工作的人， 看过这些真实内部资料的人， 知道事情内幕的人， 看到官员们誓称 没有滥用权力， 没有违反国安局的条例， 那时已经知晓 这一切即将被公诸于世。 但是，特别有趣的事实是， 美国国家安全局违反了 他们自己的条例，自己的法律 一年中高达数千次， 包括自身的一个事件， 2776件中的一个， 影响了超过3000个人。 在另一事件中， 他们无意中窃听了 华盛顿特区的所有电话。 令人惊讶的是， 这份报告，并没有得到 很大程度的关注， 因为事实上， 远不止那2776起滥用职权， 参议院情报委员会主席， 丹妮・费恩斯坦， 在华盛顿邮报联系她 请她就此事做出评论前， 她还未看过这份报告。 随后她向国安局索取了这份材料， 她收到了， 但她此前从未见过这份材料。 这意味着什么呢？ 美国情报机关 得到了怎样的监管？ 甚至连参议院情报委员会主席 都不知道每年这些规则 都被破坏了数千次？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:20	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：爱德华， 对于这整场辩论的一个回应这样说道： 老实说，我们为什么 要在乎这样的监督？ 我的意思是，如果你没做坏事， 你就不值得对此感到担忧。 这样的观点有怎样的错误？ 爱德华・斯诺登：首先， 你放弃了自己的权利。 你说，嘿，你知道， 我不认为自己需要这样的权利， 所以我决定信任他们， 无所谓，没关系， 这些人（国安局）在做正确的事。 你的权利是重要的， 因为你永远不知道， 在未来的某个时刻， 你很可能需要这样的权利。 除此之外，这是我们 文化认同的一个组成部分， 不只在美国， 而是在整个西方社会 还有全球范围内的民主社会。 人们应该能够拿起电话 打给他们的家人， 人们应该能够发短信 给他们的爱人， 人们应该能够在网上买书， 人们应该能够乘坐火车去旅行， 人们应该能够去买机票， 而不需要想着，这些行为 将会被政府的机构监察， 说不定在未来 这些监察你的 甚至都不是你的政府， 他们将会怎样曲解 他们会怎样揣测你的意图。 我们有隐私权。 我们需要正当的理由，合理的根据， 或者比方说窃听某些个别的嫌疑人， 因为我们意识到，相信他人， 任何政府机构， 将通讯的全部内容交予他们， 在秘密地，不被监管的情况下， 实在是无法忽略的诱惑。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：有些人 对你所做的一切感到暴怒。 我最近听说，迪克 切尼说道， （美国副总统 2001-2009） 朱利安 阿桑奇所做的事 （维基解密）仅能称作跳蚤叮咬， 而爱德华 斯诺登则是 把狗头咬掉的狮子。 他认为，你所做的是 美国历史上 最恶劣的叛国罪。 你要对持有这样观点的人 做出怎样的回应呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 迪克 切尼可真了不起。 （笑声）（掌声） 谢谢。（笑声） 我认为这很惊人，因为当 朱利安 阿桑奇做那些伟大工作的时候， 迪克 切尼曾说 阿桑奇会让世界范围内的政府终结， 天空会被点燃 海洋会蒸发消失， 现在他又说阿桑奇的行为 只是跳蚤叮咬。 所以我们应该对于这种 过分宣扬国家安全易受到破坏 的政府官员保持怀疑。 但是，让我们假设， 这类人真的坚信这样的想法。 我想他们对于国家安全 有一个非常狭隘的概念。 像迪克 切尼这样有特权的人， 没有保障国家的安全。 公众利益并不永远和 国家利益保持一致。 与那些不是我们敌人的人 进行战争， 战争的地点也 不对我国形成任何威胁， 这并没有让人民更加安全， 这个道理适用于伊拉克战争 和互联网上的监听行为。 互联网不是敌人。 我们的经济不是敌人。 美国的商业活动， 中国的商业活动， 那些商业公司 是我们社会的一个部分。 这是我们全球范围交流的 一个组成部分。 这些连结就像互助会一样， 把我们联系在一起， 如果我们摧毁这些纽带 以毁坏标准，安全， 行为方式， 上述这些正是全世界 其它国家和公民 期待美国能够遵守的准则。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:13	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 但是，据说你窃取了 一百七十多万份资料。 至今，看似只有其中数百份文件 是分享给记者们的。 是不是未来还会有 更多的揭秘呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:27	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：未来 绝对会有更多的揭秘。 我认为一些最重要的 必须要揭露的材料 仍旧尚未公布。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:41	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 来这边，我想要问你 有关此特定的启示。 过来看看这个。 这是一个故事，我觉得 对很多在这个房间里面的技术员来说 是过去的几个月中听到 最令人震惊的事情。 这个项目叫做“布尔溪”。 你能解释一下什么是吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:01	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 布尔溪， （译注：美国南北战争始于布尔溪战役） 这里我们再次感谢 国安局将此事开诚布公， 这个程序以一次内战名字命名。 英国人称之为刀锋山， （译注：第一次英国内战开始于刀锋山战役） 这是英国内战战场。 因此，我认为他们的这种命名方式 是由于他们的目标是国内设施。 这些程序是国安局 故意误导合作的企业伙伴的。 他们告诉合作企业伙伴 这是符合安全标准的。 他们说，嗨，让我们一起工作 以确保你的系统安全， 但事实上，他们给予的建议 非常糟糕， 使得这些公司 降低了其服务的安全性。 他们搭建的程序后门 不仅国安局可以进入， 任何其他有钱有闲的人 都能研究并搜索到。 使得他们自己 能够进入全球通信平台。 这是很危险的， 因为当我们失去一个 单一标准的时候， 如果我们失去对 加密套接字协议层(SSL)的信任， 这正是 布尔溪项目的主要目标， 我们将生活在不那么安全的世界。 我们不能够访问我们的银行 我们不能够从事商务活动 而无需担心有人监测这些通信 或根据他们自己的目的而改变这些通信。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:27	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：那么 这样的决定是否可能 会将美国网络置于危险境地， 开放给来自其它源头的攻击吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:38	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 绝对是这样。 其中一个问题， 最危险的结果之一 我们已经看到在后911时代， 国安局传统上来说有两个责任。 他们一直负责进攻性行动， 也就是黑客入侵， 但它们也一直负责防御行动 传统上他们习惯于总是优先 采用防御手段， 其所基于的原则是， 美国机密有更高的价值。 如果我们侵入中国商业系统 偷盗他们的秘密， 如果我们侵入柏林某个政府办事处 偷盗了他们的秘密， 这对美国人来说价值不高， 更重要的是确保中国 无法发掘到我们的秘密。 这样降低了我们的通信安全系数， 他们不仅把全球网络置于风险中， 并且把美国置于风险中， 因为知识产权是基本， 是经济的基础， 如果因为安全薄弱 而把知识产权置于危险境地， 我们会为此而付出多年的代价。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:40	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森: 但是他们做了一个计算 认为这是值得的 作为美国反恐的一部分。 当然，使得这成为值得付出的代价。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:50	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：嗯，当你看看 这些程序在阻止恐怖主义活动中 所发挥的作用， 你会发现，这是毫无根据的， 你不必相信我的话， 因为我们有过第一次公开法庭， 第一联邦法院审查了这一点， 超出保密协议， 这些程序被称为奥威尔， 并且这有可能违反了宪法。 国会有权涉入 要求国安局介绍解释这些事情， 现在希望去 起草条例草案审议并进行改革， 并且有两个独立的白宫评审会议 审查了所有机密证据， 指出这些行动从来没有阻止过 任何一次即将在美国 发生的恐怖袭击。 我们真的成功阻止了恐怖主义吗？ 这些程序具有任何价值吗？ 我认为没有， 美国政府中的三个部门也说没有。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:48	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 我的意思是，你认为有一个 比反恐战争更深层的动机吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:53	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 很抱歉， 我没听清，你能再说一遍吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
21:55	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 抱歉。 你认为有一个更深层的动机， 除了反恐战争之外的原因吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
22:01	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：是的。原则上，恐怖主义 一直是我们在情报界 拿来当做采取行动的外壳。 恐怖主义是具有挑衅性的词语， 它使人们产生情绪反应， 从而合理化授权权力和程序， 这是除恐怖主义外他们不会认同的。 布尔溪和刀锋山这样的项目， 国家安全局要求这样的授权 回到1990年代。 他们要求联邦调查局向国会备案， 联邦调查局去到国会备案， 但国会和美国人民说不要。 他们说，这不值得让 我们的经济去冒险。 他们说为得到这些，会对我们的社会 造成过大的伤害。 但我们看到的是， 在后911时代， 他们使用保密和以对抗恐怖主义为理由 秘密启动这些程序， 不过问国会， 不过问美国人民， 就是那种躲在紧闭大门后的政府 人们需要保护自己去反对它， 因为它使我们越发危险， 并且没有提供任何价值。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:03	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森: 好的，请跟我来这儿， 我想要问你一些个人问题。 说到恐惧， 大多数人认为你现在 在俄罗斯的处境非常可怕。 你显然听说过曾经发生过的那些事， 布拉德利 曼宁得到了怎样的对待， 他现在改名为切尔西 曼宁， Buzzfeed 上有这样一个故事， 情报系统的一些人 希望你死。 你要怎样应付？ 你怎样应对恐惧？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
23:36	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：这不奇怪 很多国家的政府想要我死。 我已经一次又一次地表明 每天早上我去睡觉 都想着我可以为美国人民做些什么。 我不想伤害我的政府。 我想要帮助我的政府， 但事实是，他们更愿意 选择忽视适当程序， 他们选择在没有一次审判的情况下 宣布我有罪， 这些都是我们需要联合起来反对的 告诉他们说，嘿，这是不合理的。 我们不应该威胁持不同政见者。 我们现在不应该定为犯罪新闻。 为了尽可能使它结束， 我很高兴这么做，尽管存在风险。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
24:32:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：所以我其实想听到 这里观众们的反馈， 因为我知道对于爱德华 斯诺登 有很多争议。 假设您有以下两个选择，好吗？ 您可以认为他所做的事 从根本上说是鲁莽的行为， 将美国置于危险境地， 或者你认为它是英勇的行为， 将对美国以及全世界 带来长远的利好？ 这是我给你的两个选择。 我很好奇，谁愿意投一票 给第一种， 认为这是一种鲁莽的行为? 我看到有手举起来了。 又有一些人举起了手。 当这个人站在这里的时候 很难举手， 但我看到他们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:15:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 我能看到你哦。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:18:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：谁选择第二项， 从根本上说英雄行为？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:22:00	<br><br>
	
（掌声）(欢呼) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
25:25:00	<br><br>
	
事实上，有很多人 并没有举手，我认为 他们都还在思考这件事， 在我看来，围绕你的辩论 不会跟随传统政治逻辑。 它不左亦不右，它不是关于 亲政府、自由主义论者，或其他的什么。 它几乎可以算是一代人的问题。 你是和互联网共同成长的 那代人之一，似乎 你感到被强烈地冒犯到了 当你看到某些事 会损害互联网的时候。 是这样的吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:02:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 是。非常正确。 这不是左或右的问题。 我们的基本自由，当我说“我们”， 我指的不仅仅是美国人， 我是指世界各地的人们， 它不是一个党派问题。 这些是人们的共同信仰的信念， 并且应该由我们来保护它， 对那些享受 一个自由开放的网络的人们， 应该由我们来保护这样的自由 让我们下一代继续享有， 如果我们不做出改变， 如果我们不有所行动做出改变 我们要努力保持互联网的安全， 不只为自己，而是为每一个人， 否则我们会失去这样的安全和自由， 那就会是一个巨大的损失， 对我们和全世界而言。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
26:49:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 嗯，我最近 从万维网的创始人那里 听到类似的言论， 他就在会议现场， 蒂姆 伯纳斯-李爵士。 蒂姆，你愿意过来参与讨论吗？ 请为蒂姆拿麦克风。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:02:00	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:04:00	<br><br>
	
蒂姆，很高兴见到你。请来这里。 顺便问一句，你站在哪边， 叛徒、英雄？我有一个理论，但是 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:17:00	<br><br>
	
蒂姆 伯纳斯-李：我已经给出了 这个问题的答案，英雄， 如果我要在这两个之间 作出选择的话。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
27:26:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 爱德华，我想你看过 蒂姆爵士说到的提案， 用大宪章夺回互联网。 这样的东西有意义吗？ 爱德华 斯诺登： 绝对有。 我的意思是，我这一代 不只是随着互联网一起成长， 而是成长于互联网， 虽然我从未想过有机会 用如此直接又实际的方式 来保卫它， 并且以这种不寻常的， 几乎阿凡达的方式， 我想有些诗意的事是， 互联网的孩子之一 由于他们的政治表达， 已实际上和互联网非常亲近了。 我相信，关于互联网的大宪章 正是我们所需要的。 我们需要加入我们的价值观， 不只是以书面形式， 也是在互联网的结构方面， 这是我所希望看到的， 我邀请每位观众， 不只是在温哥华这里的， 也包括世界各地的人 加入和参与进来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:34:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：你还有 什么问题想问爱德华吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:36:00	<br><br>
	
蒂姆 伯纳斯-李: 嗯，两个问题， 一个一般的问题―― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:39:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华， 你还能听到我们吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:41:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：是，我可以听到。 克里斯 安德森： 哦，他回来了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:45:00	<br><br>
	
蒂姆 伯纳斯-李：你线上的窃听器 这会儿有点儿被干扰了。 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:50:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 是有点儿国安局的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
28:52:00	<br><br>
	
蒂姆 伯纳斯-李： 那么，从 25 年， 回过头来思考， 你认为 基于现在的讨论， 关于想要怎样的网络环境， 我们能做到的最好状态是什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
29:08:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：当我们想到 我们能走多远， 我认为这个问题仅仅是关于 我们愿意投入些什么。 我想我们过去所享受的互联网 也正是我们作为一个国家的人民 和世界各地的人们所需要的， 开展合作，不只是让 技术部分参与进来， 而是正如你所说的，用户们， 全世界那些使用互联网， 通过互联网，通过社会媒体， 哪怕只是看看天气的人， 那些将互联网视作生活一部分 依靠互联网度过每一天的人， 来达到目标。 我们将得到的不只是 我们已拥有的互联网， 而是一个更好的互联网， 更好的当下， 我们可以用来建立未来的东西 比我们所期待的好， 比我们所能想象的好。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:06:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： TED 创建于 30 年前，1984 年， 自那时以来，许多的对话 是关于 其实，乔治 奥威尔错了。 不是老大哥在看着我们。 我们，通过网络的力量， 和透明度，正在看着老大哥。 你的揭示正如一个木桩 穿过乐观看法的心脏， 但你仍然相信有办法 对此做出反应。 你也这样做了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
30:36:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登：对的， 有这样的说法， 老大哥的权力 得到了大幅度增长。 耶鲁大学有最近有篇法律文章 建立了 Bankston-Soltani 原则， 意思是，我们对私隐的期望 在当政府监控能力的 成本变得越发低廉的时候 被违反了， 每次发生这类状况时， 我们需要重新审视 和重新平衡我们的隐私权利。 现在，政府的监控权力 增加了数个级别， 然而我们什么都没做。 这就是我们今天 所遇到的问题， 但，仍然是有希望的， 因为个人的力量 也因科技得到了增强。 我就是活生生的例子 个人可以去和 全世界范围内 最强大的对手 最强大的情报机构 正面交锋并且赢得胜利， 我认为这就是 我们希望的来源， 我们要继续建立 让从技术专家 世界各地的普通公民 都能访问。 新闻不是一种犯罪， 沟通不是一种犯罪， 我们的日常生活不应当被监视。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
31:58:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：我不太清楚 如何和你的移动机器人握手， 但我想象手放在这里。 蒂姆 伯纳斯-李：很快就会实现。 爱德华 斯诺登： 很高兴见到你， 我希望我看起来很好， 正如我看到你们的样子。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:12:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森： 谢谢你，蒂姆。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:15:00	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:20:00	<br><br>
	
纽约时报最近呼吁对你大赦。 你会接受回到美国的机会吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
32:29:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 绝对。真的没有问题， 这一项目所基于的 原则 是公众利益 以及那建基于美国以及世界各地 新闻业基石 的原则， 我觉得如果现在媒体说， 我们支持这些， 这是会发生， 也是需要发生的， 这是一个有力的论据， 但不是最终论据， 我认为这是该交由公众决定的。 但在同一时间， 政府曾暗示他们想要 某种交易， 他们想让我妥协 一直以来和我一起工作的记者们 回来， 我想要清楚地表明 我这么做不是为了安全。 我做的是正确的事， 我不会停止我的工作 放弃公众利益， 只是为了使自己受益。 （鼓掌） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:35:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：与此同时， 感谢网络和这项科技成果， 你在这里，以这种形式，回到了北美， 不是美国，而是加拿大。 我很好奇，你感觉怎样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
33:51:00	<br><br>
	
爱德华 斯诺登： 加拿大和我所期待的不同。 温暖多了。 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:01:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：在 TED， 我们的宗旨是“值得传播的思想”， 如果你能精华到一个想法， 什么是当下你认为 值得传播的思想呢？ 爱德华 斯诺登：我想说， 去年发生的事提醒我们 在紧闭的门前，民主也许已经覆灭， 但我们作为个体 在紧闭的门后出生， 我们没必要为了好的政府 而放弃自己的隐私。 我们没必要为了安全 而放弃我们的自由。 并且我认为，通过合作 我们可以同时拥有开放的政府 和私人的生活， 我想和世界上的每一位共同努力 来期待这天的到来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:46:00	<br><br>
	
非常感谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:47:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯 安德森：爱德华，谢谢你。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
34:49:00	<br><br>
	
（鼓掌） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Government surveillance ― this is just the beginning</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Christopher Soghoian	<br><br>
	
 Mar 2014 	<br><br>
	
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
The 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries, who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond, they ramped up surveillance of activists, journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist, who was arrested and tortured by his government, has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:41	<br><br>
	
Of course, it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead, they use tools like Skype, which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments, specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire, instead they now hack into your computer, enable your webcam, enable your microphone, and steal documents from your computer. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:19	<br><br>
	
When the government of Egypt fell in 2011, activists raided the office of the secret police, and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation, by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in-house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise, and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale, but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:12	<br><br>
	
So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really, they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air-conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know, your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:33	<br><br>
	
This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible, and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course, he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments, he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world, many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said, it's a $5 billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now, Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
(Video) Narrator: You want to look through your target's eyes. (Music) You have to hack your target. ["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"] You have to hit many different platforms. ["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux"] You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data. [Skype & encrypted calls, target location, messaging, relationships, web browsing, audio & video"] Being stealth and untraceable. ["Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure"] Deployed all over your country. ["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot"] Exactly what we do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:39	<br><br>
	
Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government. Many, many countries it's been found in. So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so, the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States, but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it, it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:33	<br><br>
	
So as I said before, governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software, and so for that reason, you see that the government of, say, Tunisia, might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology, and so for several years, I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:01	<br><br>
	
My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- they're a civil society group ― obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted, but what you can see from the slides, if I zoom in, is this term: Remote Operations Unit. Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research, and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn, the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit, and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. (Laughter) So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal, and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team, the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams, microphones, steal documents, get web browsing information, the works. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:20	<br><br>
	
There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking, and that's that terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology, and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys, they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:47	<br><br>
	
So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique, but without any real debate. In the United States, where I live, there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique, and because of its power and potential for abuse, it's vital that we have an informed public debate. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:09	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:11	<br><br>

2011年的阿拉伯之春 引起全世界的关注， 也受到其他国家 独裁政府的关注， 那些担心革命蔓延的政府。 为此，他们加强 对激进分子、记者 和异己分子的监控， 害怕他们受到启发 在自己国家发动革命。 一个著名的巴林激进分子 被政府抓捕并受到拷问， 他说讯问人给他看 他的电话记录 和短信誊本， 当然，政府可以监听电话和监视短信， 这并不是秘密， 正因如此，很多激进分子 也特别避免使用电话， 而使用其他工具比如 SKYPE（网络电话）， 他们认为这样就可以避免受到监视， 他们错了。 在过去几年， 一个专门提供 监听技术给政府的公司， 特别是让政府 入侵监视目标的电脑， 入侵监视目标的电脑， 他们除了通过窃听截听信息外， 现在他们也会入侵你的电脑， 通过你的网络摄像机，或者麦克风 盗取电脑上的文件。 2011年，当埃及政府倒台， 激进分子突袭秘密警局的办公室， 在他们发现的很多文件中， 有一份来自伽玛公司， 属于伽玛国际。 伽玛是一间德国公司， 生产监控软件， 产品只卖给政府， 需要注意的是很多政府 自身并没有实力 来开发软件， 较小的政府甚至没有资源 或者经验去开发， 所以西方的公司就有了这样的市场， 他们很愿意提供各样的工具 和技术， 伽玛就是这样的一间公司， 我还注意到实际上伽玛 并没有把软件卖给埃及政府， 他们只是给埃及政府报价， 但是埃及人并没有买， 而很明显埃及政府 使用的是免费版本， （笑声） 所以这个截图是来自 一个伽玛生产的销售视频， 事实上，他们只是强调， 通过一个简单的演讲， 警察可以坐在空调办公室里， 警察可以坐在空调办公室里， 远程监控某些人， 而被监视的人却无从所知。 你知道，网络摄像机的灯不会亮起， 没有任何显示麦克风是开着的。 这是伽玛国际的管理总裁 他的名字是 Martin Muench 现有很多 Muench 先生的照片, 这是我最喜欢的一张, 我只是放大一点点他的网络摄像机， 你可以看到有一张小纸条, 那个是他的网络摄像机， 他知道会发生什么样的监控, 并且很明显他也不想被利用 来对抗他。 Muench　说过他希望 他的软件被使用 来捕捉恐怖分子和定位恋童癖的人 当然，他也承认一旦 软件卖给政府， 他也不知道将被如何使用， 伽玛软件已经服务于 世界各地的国家， 很多是骇人听闻的跟踪记录 和侵犯人权的事件， 他们会卖软件给世界各地， 伽玛不是这个产业里唯一的公司， 正如我说，这是一个50亿美金的行业， 另外一个巨头是 一间意大利公司名为骇客团队　 （Hacking Team）, 骇客团队可能做出了 最花言巧语的广告, 他们做的视频很性感, 我现在就给你们展示一个短片, 就是让你们感受下 软件究竟能做什么, 同样也看看他们是怎么推销产品 给政府顾客的 （视频）叙述：你想看穿目标的眼睛 （音乐） 你必须骇客你的目标， ［“当你的目标浏览网页、 收发文件、接收信息、跨越边境”］ 你必须击中不同的平台 ［“视窗、OS X、iOS、安卓、 黑莓、Symbian，Linux”］ 你必须通过加密软件 来获得相关数据 [Skype 和加密电话、 目标地、短信、关系、 网页、音频和视频“］ 变得隐秘和无法追踪 ［不受任何保护系统影响 隐藏在基础设施中］ 部署在你们国家的各个角落 ［”由一个单一的地方 来控制超过成百上千的目标］ 正是我们所做的。 柯里斯．索侯恩：所以， 如果那不是真的就很有趣， 但事实上，骇客团队的软件 已经卖给世界各地的政府。 例如，去年我们知道， 摩洛哥政府已经用它 来监控摩洛哥的记者。 很多很多国家已经被发现使用。 所以，骇客团队也主动地推销给 美国执法部门市场。 去年左右， 公司在马里兰开了销售部门， 并雇佣了一个发言人。 他们参加了 各式各拥募嗫匦幸狄然嵋椋 执法官员都有参加。 他们在会议上发言。 我认为最有意思的是 今年较早前 的其中一个执法会议， 在中场休息时，他们客喝咖啡。 我不能确切地告诉你骇客团队 是否在美国卖过他们的技术， 但是我可以告诉你们， 如果他们没卖出去， 并不是因为他们没有尽力。 所以正如我所说的， 那些政府真的没有资源 生产自家工具， 就会购买现成的监视软件， 也正因为如此， 你会看到例如突尼斯政府， 可能使用跟德国政府相同的软件， 他们都在购买现成的东西。 美国联邦调查局的预算 包括建立自己监听技术 并且已有数年， 我正在尝试弄明白 FBI 有没有和怎样 入侵监视目标的电脑。 我一个在电子前哨基金会工作的朋友， 这是一个民间社会组织， 得到 FBI 数百份文件， 详细描述他们下一代的监视技术， 很多文件都被批量遮挡， 但是字里行间， 如果我放大，就是这些： 远程控制单元。 现在，当我第一次看到这些， 我从来没听过这个单元。 我研究监视技术已经有六年多了， 却从来没有听过。 所以我上网做了些调查， 最终找到了出处。 当我进入linkedin， 找工作的社交网站。 有很多前美国政府的承包商 在远程控制单元 那块领域工作， 在简历中详述很多细节， 有关他们所做的事情， （笑声） 所以我做了这个信息， 并且交给一个我认识信任的 华尔街日报记者， 他能够联系上 其他的前执法官员， 那些证实 事实上，FBI确实存在一个团队， 专门骇客 所监视的电脑。 像伽玛和骇客团队， FBI 也有能力 通过远程监控摄像头，麦克风， 来盗取资料，获得网页信息， 文件。 这是一个大问题， 就是政府监听问题， 和那些恐怖分子，恋童癖者， 毒品交易者，记者们，和人权活动家 所有使用同类电脑的人， 没有毒品交易者的电话 也没有记者的笔记本。 我们都使用相同的技术， 并且那意味着对政府而言， 有能力通过电脑监视 真正的坏人， 他们还有能力 也监听我们的设备。 所以全世界的政府 已拥有这项技术。 他们利用骇客 作为一个执法技术， 但是没有真正意义的舆论。 在美国，我生活的地方， 没有国会听证会。 没有法律通过 特别授权这项技术， 并且因为它的权力和潜在的滥用， 我们很有必要让公众知晓这些事实，并且就此展开辩论。 谢谢大家。 (掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Why good hackers make good citizens</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion. As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City ― and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
I'm going to talk about hackers. And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin, but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:22	<br><br>
	
The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous, or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity, or of an international rogue with a political agenda. And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:48	<br><br>
	
But like most things in technology and the technology world, hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil. For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill. Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system, and it is a deeply democratic activity. It's about critical thinking. It's about questioning existing ways of doing things. It's the idea that if you see a problem, you work to fix it, and not just complain about it. And in many ways, hacking is what built America. Betsy Ross was a hacker. The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack. And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs, hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:43	<br><br>
	
So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today, it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is, you think not of this guy but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the greatest hackers of all time. He was one of America's most prolific inventors, though he famously never filed a patent, because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available. He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod, and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
And in Code For America, we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin. He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action. He believed that government could be built by the people, and we call those people civic hackers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:37	<br><br>
	
So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy, like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise, are the same values that underly the Internet. And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:56	<br><br>
	
But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like, I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker. You just have to believe that you can bring a 21st-century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces. And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects. So keep that in mind. All of you are potential civic hackers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:25	<br><br>
	
So what does civic hacking look like? Our team last year in Honolulu, which in this case was three full-time fellows who were doing a year of public service, were asked by the city to rebuild the website. And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had. So instead, they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website. They're looking for answers to questions, and they want to take action when they're done, which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this. So our team built Honolulu Answers, which is a super-simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action. Now the site itself was easy enough to build, but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content. It would have taken the three of them a very long time, especially given that none of them are actually from Honolulu. And so they did something that's really radical, when you think about how government is used to working. They asked citizens to write the content. So you've heard of a hack-a-thon. They held a write-a-thon, where on one Saturday afternoon -- ("What do I do about wild pigs being a nuisance?") (Laughter) ― Wild pigs are a huge problem in Honolulu, apparently. In one Saturday afternoon, they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions, but more importantly than that, they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself, but it gets more awesome. On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland, where I live, the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers, and again we held a write-a-thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them, and I got into the act. I authored this answer, and a few others. And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation. And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking, we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:58	<br><br>
	
At this point, you may be wondering what city officials think of all this. They actually love it. As most of you guys know, cities are being asked every day to do more with less, and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems. So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting, cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:25	<br><br>
	
Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon. It's happening across the globe, and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City, where earlier this year, the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills. So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House. And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars. Now a lot of people were really angry about this, especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app. But instead of taking to the streets, they issued a challenge. They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper, and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars -- 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract, and they gave the entrants 10 days. And in those 10 days, they submitted 173 apps, five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today. And because of this action, that contract was vacated, and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners, Code for Mexico City. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:49	<br><br>
	
And so what you see in all three of these places, in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City, are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking. It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them, and through that work, they're creating a 21st-century ecosystem of participation. They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved, besides voting or signing a petition or protesting. They can actually build government. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
So back to our friend Ben Franklin, who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia, called a brigade. And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city, so in true civic hacker fashion, they built a solution. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:46	<br><br>
	
And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described, and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us. We have 31 brigades in the U.S. We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the brigade to international cities for the first time, starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland. You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org, and if there's not a brigade where you live, we will help you. We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org, and we will support you along the way. Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems, that will support local government, and that will empower citizens. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
So please come hack with us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:40	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

今天我要谈的是有关黑客的话题。 当我说到“黑客”这个词的时候 你脑中所出现的画面可能不会是 本杰明・富兰克林， 但我想要告诉你， 为什么应该是富兰克林。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:22	<br><br>
	
你脑中出现的画面 估计是一个面色苍白的年轻人 在地下室里做坏事 他可能要盗用你的身份， 或者进行有政治意图的 跨国诈骗。 主流文化告诉我们 黑客是我们应当害怕 并且远离的人群。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:48	<br><br>
	
但是，在科技世界里的 大部分科技活动， 黑客制造福祉 和破坏的能力是等同的。 有个在试图盗用你身份的黑客 同时就有一个黑客在创建 可以帮助你在灾难后寻找亲人的工具， 或者在漏油事件后 监控环境质量的工具。 黑客行为真的只是一种对现有系统 的业余创新行为， 并且是一种影响深远的民主活动， 它与批判性思维有关， 它也与挑战现有的处事方式有关。 主要的意义是，当你发现问题， 你不是仅仅在旁边抱怨， 而是会找到方法去解决问题。 从某种程度上来说， 黑客行为建立了美国， 贝琪・罗斯是一个黑客。 （译者注：她设计并缝制了美国第一面国旗） 地铁的设计是一个绝妙的黑客发明。 从怀特兄弟到史蒂夫・乔布斯， 黑客行为一直是美国 民主的基石。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:43	<br><br>
	
所以今天，我想要告诉你们最重要的是， 下次当你们想黑客是什么样的时候， 你不要想到这个家伙， 而是这位先生，本杰明・富兰克林， 他是史上最伟大的黑客。 他是美国最多产的发明家之一， 尽管他不曾有一个专利， 因为他认为，人类的知识发明 应免费共享。 他发明了双光眼镜和避雷针， 当然，他还协助建立了 美国民主制度。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
我所在的机构“为美国编程”（ code for america） 就尝试去实践本杰明 ・ 富兰克林的精神。 他是一位多面手和政治家， 他认为，作为公民 需要将公民的想法付诸行动。 他认为政府可以 由人民建立， 我们称呼这些人为公民黑客。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:37	<br><br>
	
所以不足为奇的是 支撑起健康的民主机制的价值基石， 像协作和赋予权力、 参与和创业精神， 和互联网的价值基石是同样的。 所以不令人意外的是，很多骇客 把注意力转向政府的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:56	<br><br>
	
但在我给你举几个例子 告诉你什么是公民黑客之前， 我想要清楚地告诉你， 你不需要先成为一名程序员才能做公民黑客。 你只需要相信，你可以 用 21 世纪的现代工具来解决 政府面临着的问题。 我们时常发现，我们 “为美国编程”社群的公民黑客 并不懂到底有多少非技术性工作 进入民间黑客项目。 因此，请记住， 你们都有可能成为公民黑客。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:25	<br><br>
	
公民黑客是怎样的呢？ 我们团队去年在檀香山， 这三位都是全职雇员， 他们正在担任为期一年的公职， 工作是按市政府的要求重建网站。 它是成千上万页面的大规模工作， 这工作，在他们仅有的几个月时间内 是不可能完成的。 所以，他们决定建立一个平行的网站 更好地符合公民实际上 想要从城市网站上 汲取信息的需求。 他们在寻找答案， 他们想要在网站做好的时候人们可以有实际的行动 从这样的一个网站 真的很难。 随后我们的团队搭建了“檀香山答案”， 它是一个超简单的搜索界面， 你只需要输入搜索词或一个问题， 就可以得到用平实语言写成的答案， 这驱使用户继续使用。 网站本身是容易建成的， 但团队面临的挑战是 他们如何填充所有内容。 这将会占用他们三个人 很长的时间， 特别是在他们都不是 檀香山本地人的情况下。 所以他们做了一件真的很前卫的事， 之所以这么讲，是因为 要他们颠覆了人们关于政府该如何运作的想象 他们要求公民自己书写内容。 你应该听说过“编程马拉松” (hack-a-thon)。 他们举行了“书写马拉松” (write-a-thon)， 在某个星期六的下午 -- ("野猪被人讨厌要怎么办?")（笑声）-- 在檀香山，野猪显然是个大问题。 在星期六的下午， 他们能够书写填充大部分内容 以解答大多数的常见问题， 但比这更重要的是， 他们创造了公民参与政府互动的新途径。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
我觉得这本身就是一个很酷的故事， 它变得越来越棒。 今年的公民黑客日 在六月时，在我居住的奥克兰举办， “为美国编程”团队在奥克兰 采取了开放“檀香山答案”源码的代码 并把它变成了“奥克兰答案”， 于是我们再次举行“书写马拉松”， 我们收集了最常见的问题， 并号召市民做出解答， 随后我开始行动。 我和其他几个人创作了这个答案。 这一天我试图感觉到 我对所生活居住的城市 有被赋予权力和责任的滋味， 这样的感受只是基于 参与活动这件这小小的举动。 把我的小小行动和 成千上万人参与的 小小行动加在一起 我们就有能力通过公民黑客行为， 重振公民权利， 并且恢复对政府的信任。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:58	<br><br>
	
此时，你可能会想 市政公务人员会如何看待这一切。 他们很喜欢。 你们中大部分人知道， 人们每天期待着 城市能花小钱办大事， 他们一直在寻找 创新的解决方案 来处理这根深蒂固的问题。 所以，当你给予公民参与的路径 除了出席市政厅会议以外的路径， 城市实际上可以汲取 居住在这里的社群的能力 来为政府出谋划策。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:25	<br><br>
	
我不想留下这样的印象 公民黑客只是美国才会出现的现象。 在全球其他地区也在发生着， 我最喜欢的例子之一 是墨西哥城，今年年初， 墨西哥众议院的代表 与一个软件开发公司签订了合同， 要建立一个应用程序， 使议员能够用来跟进条例草案。 这只是为少数几个 在众议院的议员。 合同为期两年, 数额为 930 万美金。 很多人都对这件事表示很生气， 特别是程序员们知道， 要写这样一个非常简单的应用程序 930 万绝对是夸张到令人愤慨的高昂报价。 但他们没有走上街头抗议， 而是发出了挑战。 他们要求在墨西哥的程序员们 创建出更好且更便宜的程序， 他们提供的奖金是 9300 美元 -- 比政府合同 便宜一万倍， 他们给参赛者 10 天时间。 在那十天里， 参赛者共提交了 173 个应用程序， 其中五个被筛选出来送往议会， 目前仍然能够在苹果在线商店看到它们。 因为这一行动， 该合同被撤销了， 在墨西哥城，现在 这行动引发了一场运动， 这是我们另一个伙伴的故事， “为墨西哥城编程”。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:49	<br><br>
	
你在这三个地方可以看到的是， 它们是檀香山，奥克兰和墨西哥城， 公民黑客核心要素的组成部分。 公民看到可改进的地方 于是决定要修复它们， 通过这项工作，他们正在创建 参与政务的 21 世纪生态系统。 他们正在创建一套全新的方法 让公民参与， 除了投票、签署请愿书 或抗议之外的政治参与行动， 实际上，他们可以建立政府。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
所以回到我们的朋友 本杰明・富兰克林， 他不那么鲜为人知的成就之一 就是于 1736 年，他在费城创立了 第一个志愿性的消防公司， 叫作“消防小分队“。 这是因为他和他的朋友们注意到 城市所遇到的麻烦 通常与在城市内着火有关， 正是因为他们有公民黑客的潜质才能这样做， 他们建立了一个解决方案。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:46	<br><br>
	
我们在“为美国编程” 组织内也有自己的旅 从事我刚才所描述的工作， 我们希望你 能够跟随本杰明・富兰克林的脚步， 来加入我们。 我们在美国有 31 个旅， 今天我们很高兴地宣布 我们的“小分队”要向国际城市开放 这是第一次发生的事， 我们开始与波兰、日本 还有爱尔兰等城市合作， 你可以在 brigade.codeforamerica.org 这网页 找出在你居住的地方是否有一个旅， 如果你居住的地方没有旅，我们将帮助你， 我们已经创建了一个工具包，也可以在 brigade.codeforamerica.org 这网站上找到， 我们会支持你一路向前。 我们的目标是创建 一个公民黑客的全球网络， 其中聚合所有试图 在现有系统上做出创新的人， 为了生成能够解决 根深蒂固的问题的工具， 能够用于帮助地方政府， 能够用于提高公民被赋予的力量。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
所以请来和我们一起当黑客。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:40	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:41	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">A new equation for intelligence</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Is there an equation for intelligence? Yes. It’s F = T ^ St. In a fascinating and informative talk, physicist and computer scientist Alex Wissner-Gross explains what in the world that means. 	<br><br>

Intelligence -- what is it? If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that "the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim." Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing. However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines. And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:23	<br><br>
	
Let's take a step back. Let's first begin with a thought experiment. Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years. And you observe a really strange effect. You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth. Now of course, as earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves. We're trying to prevent an impact. But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that. And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:56	<br><br>
	
So in this program that I undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines, that were pointing, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence. In cosmology, for example, there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. In game play, for example, in Go -- everyone remembers in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess -- fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of Go, arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor, has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason: the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play. Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads? Is there a single equation for intelligence? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
4:36	<br><br>
	
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ^ St"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc2 for intelligence that I've seen. So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped. Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open. And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this? How predictive is it? Does it predict human-level intelligence? Does it predict artificial intelligence? So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:45	<br><br>
	
(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves. But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship? What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it? To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in. Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so. Here are some examples of Entropica in action. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
6:33	<br><br>
	
Just like a human standing upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart. This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal. It simply decided on its own to balance the pole. This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies. Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position. This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture. In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task. This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:37	<br><br>
	
Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains. For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming. Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected. This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence. Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific. By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
8:25	<br><br>
	
Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-low, sell-high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially. This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation, which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
9:06	<br><br>
	
Now, there's a profound irony here. Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play "RUR," there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt. The machines would rise up against us. One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse. It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world. It's quite the opposite, that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence, that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control-grabbing, rather than vice versa. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:09	<br><br>
	
Another important consequence is goal seeking. I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework? And the answer is, the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense: just like you would travel through a tunnel, a bottleneck in your future path space, in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on, or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerges directly from a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:51	<br><br>
	
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together. My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:36	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">The world is one big dataset. Now, how to photograph it </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
We're all familiar with satellite imagery, but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date. That's because satellites are big and expensive, so there aren't that many of them up in space. As he explains in this fascinating talk, Dan Berkenstock and his team came up with a different solution, designing a cheap, lightweight satellite with a radically new approach to photographing what's going on on Earth. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>

Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student living two lives. In one, I used NASA supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft, and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses, mostly of facilities, industrial facilities around the world. And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. And one day, I was thinking about how all data has a location, and I realized that the answer had been staring me in the face. Although I was a satellite engineer, I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery in my work. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
Now, like most of us, I'd been online, I'd see my house, so I thought, I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. And what I found really surprised me. The pictures that I was finding were years out of date, and because of that, it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today. But I was intrigued. I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff. There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today, but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis. How much oil is stored in all of China? How much corn is being produced? How many ships are in all of our world's ports? Now, in theory, all of these questions could be answered by imagery, but not if it's old. And if this data was so valuable, then how come I couldn't get my hands on more recent pictures? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:49	<br><br>
	
So the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. And today, there's a handful of the great, great grandchildren of these early Cold War machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and I see on a daily basis comes. During this period, launching things into space, just the rocket to get the satellite up there, has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and that's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do, you cram as much functionality in there as possible. All of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive, now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy. Because they are so expensive, there aren't very many of them. Because there aren't very many of them, the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally, but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected, some friends and I put together a dataset of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between 2000 and 2010. As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world are barely seen, less than once a year, and even the areas that are seen most frequently, those in red, are seen at best once a quarter. Now as aerospace engineering grad students, this chart cried out to us as a challenge. Why do these things have to be so expensive? Does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets? Wasn't there a way to build a smaller, simpler, new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites, but fortunately we had help. In the late 1990s, a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. This was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites. This dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of 100, and suddenly we could afford to experiment, to take a little bit of risk, and to realize a lot of innovation. And a new generation of engineers and scientists, mostly out of universities, began launching these very small, breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats. And these were built with electronics obtained from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:31	<br><br>
	
Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and I began a series of sketches of our own satellite design. And I can't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things, but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset, of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy, of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found, it just seemed boring to go work on anything else. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:05	<br><br>
	
And so we moved into a cramped, windowless office in Palo Alto, and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab. The first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing. In space, size drives cost, and we had worked with these very small, breadbox-sized satellites in school, but as we began to better understand the laws of physics, we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited, because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope, and these satellites had a very small, very constrained volume. And we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this. Although this was the low-cost option, quite frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable. So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images, but get a lot of them at an affordable price. From our own computer simulations, we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy, for the first time, being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis, while conveniently still not being able to see individuals. We had found our compromise. We would have to build something larger than the original breadbox, now more like a mini-fridge, but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck. So now we had our constraint. The laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
What came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible, basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb. The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner, similar to a Xerox machine, and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures, scanning row by row by row to build the complete image. Now people use these because they get a lot of light, which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image. The problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing. You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target from over 600 miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second, which requires an awesome degree of complexity. So instead, we turned to a new generation of video sensors, originally created for use in night vision goggles. Instead of taking a single, high quality image, we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames, but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground, at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system. And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well, and day by day, our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:32	<br><br>
	
A few short weeks ago, we packed up SkySat 1, put our signatures on it, and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth. Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks. And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
So why do all of this? Why build these satellites? Well, it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency, and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come. We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier, and beyond economic data, unlocking the human story, moment by moment. For a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid, it just doesn't get much better than that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:31	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

五年前，我是个博士生 过着两种生活 在一种生活里 我用NASA（美国国家航空航天局）的超级电脑 设计新一代的航天器 在另一种生活里，我是一个数据科学家 寻找那些敏感核技术的 潜在走私者 作为一个数据科学家，我做了很多的分析 大部分是对设施的分析 世界各地的工业设施 而我一直在寻找一个可以更好的框架 可以将这些都联结起来 有一天，我正在思考 所有的数据是如何定位的 然后我意识到 答案一直就在我的眼前 虽然我是一个卫星工程师 我却从来没有想过将卫星图像 运用到我的工作中 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
现在，我会像大多数人一样 上网看看自己的房子，于是我想 我也可以开始研究研究 其中的一些设施 结果我被自己看到的震惊了 那些我看到的图像 已经过时好多年了 也因为如此 它跟我当时的工作 几乎没什么关联 不过我很着迷 大家都知道，卫星图像是非常了不起的东西 今天我们身边有成千上百万的 传感器 然而每天都还有那么多 我们不知道的东西 中国藏有多少石油？ 有多少玉米被生产出来？ 全世界的所有港口有多少船只？ 理论上，所有的这些问题 都可以用图像来回答 不过如果是老的图像就不行了 并且如果这些数据真的那么重要 那为什么我不可以获得 更新的图像呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:49	<br><br>
	
故事始于50多年前 美国政府发射的 第一代照片侦查卫星 如今，还有少数 这些早期冷战时期的机器的 曾子孙们 它们现在多由私营公司运作 也是我们今天日常看到的 绝大部分的卫星图像的来源 在此期间，把东西发射到太空 仅仅是用火箭将一个卫星送上去 一次就要花掉数亿美元，十亿啊 这种强大的压力下 不能过于频繁地 发射东西 而当你发射东西的时候 就要保证塞进去的功能越多越好 所有的这一切都导致了卫星 变得越来越大 也越来越贵 如今每个要花掉近10亿美元 因为它们如此昂贵 所以数量就不是很多 因为数量不是很多 我们日常看到的图像 就偏陈旧 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
我想很多人可以理解这个故事 不过为了能让大家更好地想象 这些卫星图像有多么稀疏 我和我的一些朋友制作了一个数据库 这个数据库里有从2000年到2010年 这些卫星收集的3000万张图像 你可以看到蓝色的区域 全球有大面积的地方 几乎看不到 图像少于一年一次 即使是那些最经常看到的区域 红色的区域 也只是最多每个季度看到一次 这时，作为航空航天工程专业的研究生 这个图给我们发起了一个挑战 为什么这些东西要如此昂贵呢？ 单单一个卫星真的必须花费 等同于3架747大型喷气式客机的费用么？ 难道没有办法造一个更小的 更简单的、更新的卫星 来提供即时的图像么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
我知道这听上去有些疯狂 我们准备自己动手 开始设计卫星 不过幸运的是，我们有帮手 在90年代后期，几个教授 提出了一个概念，可以大幅降低 将东西发射到太空的成本 即在发射大卫星的时候 顺带稍上小卫星 这让送东西上太空的成本 降低了100倍 于是突然之间，我们可以做更多的实验 冒更多的风险 追求更多的创新 新一代的工程师和科学家们 他们大部分来自大学 开始打造这些很小的 面包盒大小的“立方体卫星” 这些卫星是用从 RadioShack公司（一家美国电子产品连锁店） 而不是洛克希德・马丁公司（一家美国航空航天制造商） 买的电子部件打造的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:31	<br><br>
	
利用从这些早期发射中学到的经验 我和我的朋友开始设计 我们自己的卫星 我不记得具体是哪一天 我们突然做了这样一个有意识的决定 就是我们真的要打造这些东西 不过一旦我们有了这些想法―― 这个世界是一个数据库 每天我们都能捕捉数百万个数据点 来描绘全球经济 我们能够发掘它们之间 从来没被发现过的、无数的关联―― 其它一切的工作 似乎都显得无趣 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:05	<br><br>
	
于是我们搬到了帕洛阿尔托 （美国加州的城市，科技创业公司的天堂） 一个拥挤的、没有窗户的办公室 并开始将我们的设计 从图版转到实验室 我们首先要对付的一大问题就是 我们要造一个多大的东西 在太空，体积决定成本 在学校，我们使用这些很小的、 面包盒大小的卫星 不过当我们开始更好地理解了物理定律 我们发现这些卫星能够获取的 图像的质量非常局限 因为物理定律决定了 通过望远镜拍的最好的照片 是这个望远镜直径的函数 而这些卫星只有很小的 非常有限的空间 我们发现我们能够捕捉到的 最好的照片，看上去是这样的 虽然这是个低成本的选择 但老实说，这实在太模糊了 这样的卫星图像也没有价值 大约三四个星期以后 我们巧遇到了一群工程师 他们曾经参与了第一架 商业成像卫星的开发工作 他们告诉我们，过去在1970年代 美国政府找到了一个强大的 最佳的权衡―― 就是以刚好一米的分辨率进行拍照 能够看到物体一米大小 他们发现，他们不仅可以获得高质量的图像 而且可以用低廉的价格获取很多 从我们自己的计算机模拟结果中 我们很快发现，一米确实是 最小的、可行的，能够看到 全球经济的驱动因素的分辨率 第一次，我们可以数 那些在地球上每天在移动的 船只、车辆、集装箱和卡车的数量 虽然还看不到清楚人物 我们找到了我们的最佳权衡点 我们需要造一个 比原有的面包盒更大的东西 更像个迷你冰箱 但是我们却不需要造一个货车 现在我们有了限制 物理定律决定了 我们能够打造的最小的望远镜 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
接下来要做的，就是把这个卫星的其它部分 造得尽可能地小而简单 基本上就是一个会飞的望远镜，它有四面墙 和一些体积比通讯录还小的 用的电比100瓦灯泡还少的电子部件 真正最大的挑战是 通过那个望远镜拍照 传统的成像卫星采用行扫描仪 类似于复印机 随着它们穿越地球，它们进行拍照 逐行地进行扫描 从而建立完整的图像 如今人们用这个，因为它们可以获得很多光线 也就意味着少一些 你在便宜的手机照片上会看到的噪点 这个方法的问题是，它们需要 非常复杂的定位 你需要从600英里以外 聚焦一个50厘米的对象 同时以每秒7公里的速度移动 这些都需要非常高的准确度 因此，我们采用了一种新的视频传感器 它最早是用于夜视镜的 我们不拍单一的高质量图像 而是拍一段 由很多帧噪点较高的图像组成的视频 然后我们在地面上 运用复杂的像素处理技术 把这些图像重新组合在一起 把这些图像重新组合在一起 组成高质量的图像 而花费只是传统办法的百分之一 我们还把这个技术 运用到卫星的很多其它系统上 一天天过去，我们的设计已经从 CAD（计算机辅助设计）变成了样机 从样机变成了实际产品 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:32	<br><br>
	
短短几个星期前 我们装好了Skysat1 我们在上面签了名 最后一次在地球上跟它挥手告别 今天，它正坐在它的最终发射装置里 准备在几个星期后升空 很快，我们会转向发射 一系列的卫星，24个或者更多 并开始建立可扩展的分析 使得我们能够从我们收集的 拍字节（10的15次方）的数据中发掘信息 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
那么为什么要做这些呢？为什么要造这些卫星？ 因为成像卫星 有提供全球透明度的独特能力 而即时提供 全球透明度的时代已经到来 我们把自己看作是新领域的先驱者 在经济数据以外 慢慢解开人类之谜 对一个碰巧 孩提时代去了太空营的数据科学家而言 没有什么比这更好的了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:31	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:34	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">How we turned the tide on domestic violence</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
When Esta Soler lobbied for a bill outlawing domestic violence in 1984, one politician called it the "Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act." "If only I had Twitter then," she mused. This sweeping, optimistic talk charts 30 years of tactics and technologies ― from the Polaroid camera to social media ― that led to a 64% drop in domestic violence in the U.S. 	<br><br>
Esta Soler	<br><br>
	
   Feb 2014	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
I want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the 1980s. They would come into the emergency room with what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel," and I would see a woman who was beaten, I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and swollen eyes. And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera, we would take her picture, we would wait 90 seconds, and we would give her the photograph. And she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court. We were making what was invisible visible. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:58	<br><br>
	
I've been doing this for 30 years. I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children. And for all those years, I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable, that it is learned, and if it's learned, it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:37	<br><br>
	
Why do I believe this? Because it's true. It is absolutely true. Between 1993 and 2010, domestic violence among adult women in the United States has gone down by 64 percent, and that is great news. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:02	<br><br>
	
Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there? Our eyes were wide open. Thirty years ago, women were beaten, they were stalked, they were raped, and no one talked about it. There was no justice. And as an activist, that was not good enough. And so step one on this journey is we organized, and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters, and if they didn't open a shelter, they opened their home so that women and children could be safe. And you know what else we did? We had bake sales, we had car washes, and we did everything we could do to fundraise, and then at one point we said, you know, it's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people's lives. Right? (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
And so, step number two, we knew we needed to change the laws. And so we went to Washington, and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation. And I remember walking through the halls of the U.S. Capitol, and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose, and I couldn't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation. I was probably 30 and naive. But I heard about a congressman who had a very, very different point of view. Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation? He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984 in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:56	<br><br>
	
Ten years later, after lots of hard work, we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act, which is a life-changing act that has saved so many lives. (Applause) Thank you. I was proud to be part of that work, and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:17	<br><br>
	
And you know what else it did? It collected data. And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data. In fact, I am a data nerd. I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here. I am a data nerd, and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar, that the program works, and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:38	<br><br>
	
And I also want to say one other thing: We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters. It is about economic empowerment for women, it is about healing kids who are hurt, and it is about prevention with a capital P. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
And so, step number three on this journey: We know, if we're going to keep making this progress, we're going to have to turn up the volume, we're going to have to increase the visibility, and we're going to have to engage the public. And so knowing that, we went to the Advertising Council, and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign. And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa, and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. Take a look at one of our spots. 	<br><br>

Esta Soler: As we were in the process of releasing this campaign, O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. We learned that he had a long history of domestic violence. The media became fixated. The story of domestic violence went from the back page, but actually from the no-page, to the front page. Our ads blanketed the airwaves, and women, for the first time, started to tell their stories. Movements are about moments, and we seized this moment. And let me just put this in context. Before 1980, do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence? I'll tell you: 158. And in the 2000s, over 7,000. We were obviously making a difference. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:04	<br><br>
	
But we were still missing a critical element. So, step four: We needed to engage men. We couldn't solve this problem with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines. And I already told you I'm a data nerd. National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. So we wondered, how can we include men? How can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls? And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said, "You want men to talk about violence against women and girls. Men don't talk." (Laughter) I apologize to the men in the audience. I know you do. But he said, "Do you know what they do do? They do talk to their kids. They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches." And that's what we did. We met men where they were at and we built a program. And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. And he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships. And all of a sudden, he looked at the back of the room, and he saw his daughter, and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela, and he said, "Michaela, come up here." And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy, and she got up there, and he said, "Sit down next to me." She sat right down next to him. He gave her this big hug, and he said, "People ask me why I do this work. I do this work because I'm her dad, and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her." And as a parent, I get it. I get it, knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under-reported. We've done a lot for adult women. We've got to do a better job for our kids. We just do. We have to. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. Technology has been our friend. The mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women, and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our story in a powerful way. And so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms, as an organizer, I say, thank you very much. Really. I clap for you. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
I'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life, the Optimist Club. You can't make that one up. And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. I have been doing this work for over 30 years, and I am convinced, now more than ever, in the capacity of human beings to change. I believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality, and I also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition. And I ask you, stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:52	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>

我希望大家能够想一下 对于在二十世纪八十年代的暴力中 遭受迫害的妇女来说 这是怎样的一个突破 她们会被送进急诊室 至于受伤的原因，警察称之为“恋人间的争端” 这时我看到的是一个被殴打的妇女 鼻子被打伤，手腕被打折 以及她肿胀的眼 作为活动家，我们会拿起我们的拍立得 拍下她的照片 等个九十秒 再把照片给她 这样，这个妇女就有了 去法院起诉的证据 我们使得看不见的东西得以显形 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:58	<br><br>
	
我做这个三十年了 我成了致力于终结 向妇女儿童施暴的 社会运动的一份子 这些年 我保持着绝对的热情 并且这么坚信着： 这种暴力并不是无可避免的 这种暴力是习得的，既然它是习得的 它就可以被戒除，可以被阻止 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:37	<br><br>
	
为什么我这么坚信？ 因为这是真的 这道理的确是对的 在一九九三至二零壹零年间 针对成年妇女的家庭暴力 在美国 下降了百分之六十四 这是个很棒的消息 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:02	<br><br>
	
百分之六十四……那么，这是怎么做到的呢？ 我们也很好奇 三十年前，妇女被殴打 被跟踪，被强奸 没人谈论她们的遭遇 对她们而言社会毫无正义可言 作为一个活动家，这样的社会并不足够好 改良运动的第一步 是我们集合起来 创造了这个不同寻常的地下网络 身处这个网络的伟大的女人们开辟了一些庇护所 她们打开了收容所， 或者开放她们的房子 他们打开他们的家 这样妇女和儿童就有了容身之所来确保安全 然后我们做了什么？ 我们买面包，洗车 做任何能做的事来募集资金 直到某天我们说 是时候去 联邦政府 要求他们为我们这种 伟大的济民工作拨款 对不对？（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
之后，第二步 我们知道我们需要修缮法律 所以我们去了华盛顿 为第一部法律进行游说 我仍记得我穿过 国会大厦的大厅 那时我三十岁，生活充满目标 我不能想象 什么人会对如此重要的的一条法律 提出异议 但我才三十，还太天真 我听到一位议员 提出了截然不同的观点 你知道他称这条 重要的法律叫什么吗 他称之为拿婚姻找乐  《拿婚姻找乐法》  女士们先生们，那是一九八四年的美国 我真希望那时有微博这玩意 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:56	<br><br>
	
十年后，经过大量艰苦公关 我们最终通过了《暴力对待妇女法》 这改变生活的法令 这拯救诸多生命的法令（掌声） 谢谢 我身为这项工作的一份子感到很自豪 这项工作改变了法律 使得百万计的美金流入本地社会 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:17	<br><br>
	
它还起了什么作用呢？收集数据 我必须得说，我很痴迷于数据 事实上，我是个数据狂人 我能确信在座很多人和我一样 我是个数据狂人 原因是我想确认 如果我花了钱，这项工作会起效 如果不起效，我们就得改换主意了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:38	<br><br>
	
我还想说另一件事 我们不想靠刑罚解决这个问题 通过建立更多的监狱 或者再建许多庇护所 而是为了使妇女拥有经济权力 以及治愈受伤的儿童 并且防止作恶 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
之后，第三步 我们知道，我们要想持续推动这项计划 我们必须加大宣传 我们必须提升存在感 我们要对公众呼吁 所以我们来到广告委员会 请求他们帮助我们 建立一个公共教育运动 我们还把目光投向加拿大 澳大利亚，巴西以及非洲的一部分 我们带着这样的知识 创建了第一个国家 公共教育运动 我们称之为“绝不为家庭暴力找理由” 看看我们的一段录像： 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:38	<br><br>
	
（视频）男人：晚饭呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:40	<br><br>
	
女人：我想你已经回家好几个小时了，我就把东西都收走了，所以…… 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:44	<br><br>
	
男人：这啥？比萨饼？ 女人：你要是刚刚给我打个电话，我就…… 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:47	<br><br>
	
男人：晚饭呢？就这玩意？ 女人：亲，别这么大声…… 女人：不要……放开我！！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:52	<br><br>
	
男人：滚进厨房！ 女人：不！救命！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
男人：来点疼的如何？（猛打女人） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
男人：疼吧？啊？疼吧！（打碎玻璃） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:00	<br><br>
	
女人：救救我！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:03	<br><br>
	
【孩子就坐在一边看着，你的借口是什么？】 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:06	<br><br>
	
E.S. :当我们推进这项运动时 推动这一运动， 辛普森由于谋害他的妻子和妻子的朋友 而被逮捕了 我们了解到他有很久的 家庭暴力历史。 媒体开始关注家暴 家暴的故事 不再被避而不谈 事实上，是从不被察觉，登上了头版 我们的广告覆盖了电视广播 女人们第一次 开始讲述她们的故事 时间对社会运动很重要 我们也抓紧了时间 来说点实际的 在一九八零年之前，你知道 纽约时报中有多少文章 是关于家暴的？ 一百五十八 在二十一世纪初，这个数字超过了七千 很显然，我们改变了社会 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:04	<br><br>
	
但我们仍旧遗落了重要的一环 所以，第四步，我们和男人们订约 没有这另一半“局外人”（男人） 我们不可能解决这个问题 我说过我是个数据狂人 国家调查显示男人们觉得被告发了 但并没有被邀请进入这次对话 所以我们想，如何把男人拉入这次对话？ 怎样才能让男人谈论 有关反妇女儿童暴力的话题 我的一个男性朋友把我拉到一边说： “你们想让男人谈论有关反妇女儿童暴力的话题？ 不可能。” （笑声） 我得对男观众道歉 事实上你们也发声了 但他说：“你知道他们做什么吗？ 他们对他们的孩子说， 作为父亲，作为导师。” 这就是我们做的 我们拜访男人 并建立了一个项目 有这么一件事 永远留在我的心中 一个篮球教练 在对满屋子的男运动员说话 男运动员们过着不同生活 他在说引导男孩到男人、 改变更衣室文化、 使男人们和谐相处 的重要性 突然之间，他看了房间后面 他看到了他的女儿 他叫出他女儿的名字，米歇尔， 他说， 米歇尔，来这里.  米歇尔九岁，有点害羞 她来到父亲身边 教练说， 坐在我身边  她就坐在他旁边。 他给了她一个大大的拥抱，他说，  有人问我为什么我做这项工作。 我做这项工作，因为我是她爸爸， 我不愿任何人伤害她的人。  作为一个母亲，我能理解 我知道 大学校园有何其多的 已知但未被报道的性袭击 所以报告说， 我们为成年妇女做了很多。 我们得为我们的孩子们做得更好。 我们就这么做了。我们必须这么做。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
我们从拍立得时期开始 走了很长的路 技术一直是我们的伙伴 移动电话改变了全球 它赋予妇女权力 Facebook 和 Twitter 和谷歌和 YouTube 和所有帮助我们组织的社会媒体 以强大的方式叙述着我们的故事。 在座的观众中 有人作为组织者 帮助我们构建应用程序以及搭建平台 我要说，谢谢你们。 真的。我为你们鼓掌。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
我爸爸 是个 乐观主义者 真的 他的乐观精神 是我的基因 我超过三十年来一直在做这项工作 30 年来， 我也相信，现在比以往任何时候 更适合人类去改变 我相信我们可以使人类历史 转向慈悲和平等 我也从根本上 热切地相信 这种暴力不是人类 之所以为人类的条件 我邀请你站在我们这边 为所有的妇女女孩男人男孩 创造一个没有暴力的未来 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:52	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>

Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old. At that age, I also learned about what an animator was. There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about. When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, "That's what I want to be." I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud, but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:31	<br><br>
	
Animation and art has always been my first love. It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for "Malicious Dishes." There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer? Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things? And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:55	<br><br>
	
At four years old, my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again. That started my love for technology. I built my first website myself in HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
I'm also working on an animated series called "The Pollinators." It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators, then all creatures, including ourselves, that depend on these plants, would starve. So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team. (Applause) (Foot stomp) (Music) (Roar) Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known! I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators! (Music) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:06	<br><br>
	
Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
All of my animations start with ideas, but what are ideas? Ideas can spark a movement. Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round. If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now with technology, medicine, art, culture, and how we even live our lives. At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas, and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet. (Laughter) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories. I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then. I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did, even my business. I would find different fabrics around the house, and say,  This could be a scarf or a hat,  and I had all these ideas for designs. I noticed when I wore my creations, people would stop me and say, "Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?" And I thought, I can start my own business. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old. I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back. My mom taught me how to sew, and on my back porch, I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon, and I would write down the names and the price of each item. I started making more items like hats, scarves and bags. Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business, like branding and marketing, staying engaged with my customers, and seeing what sold the most and the least. Soon, my business really started to take off. Then one day, Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old. (Laughter) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:07	<br><br>
	
Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly? I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little. My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet, so I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed, there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials. These actions can pollute the air, making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it. So when I started my business, I knew two things: All of my items had to be eco-friendly, and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. (Applause) I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future. I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:18	<br><br>
	
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it. But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts, because when you get it through your heart, that is when movements are sparked. That is when opportunities and innovation are created, and that is why ideas come to life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:40	<br><br>
	
Thank you, and peace and blessings. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:45	<br><br>

玛雅・佩恩: 在我会拿蜡笔的时候 我就开始画画了， 从三岁开始，我就在 制作动画手翻书， 很小的时候，我就知道 动画片绘制者是什么。 那时有一个关于工作的电视节目， 大多数孩子都不知道那是什么。 当我了解到，我在电视上看到的卡通 都出自动画设计者之手的时候， 我马上说："我想要成为这样的人。" 我不知道是否以一种疯狂或大声的语气， 但那是我生命中重大的决定性时刻。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:31	<br><br>
	
动画和艺术一直是我的最爱。 我对技术的热爱点亮了 “邪恶菜肴”这个想法， 我的电脑上有病毒， 我一直在试图消除它， 突然之间，我想到， 病毒们在计算机内部 有自己的小世界吗？ 也许有个餐厅，病毒们时常在那里碰面 做坏事？ 因此，"邪恶菜肴"出现了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:55	<br><br>
	
在我四岁的时候，我爸爸展示了 如何拆开计算机，再把它拼装回去的过程。 这开启了我对技术的喜爱。 我用超文本标记语言 搭建了自己的第一个网站， 我正在学习脚本语言和和 Python 语言。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
我同时还在制作一个动画系列， 叫作"传粉者"。 有关于自然界中蜜蜂和其它传粉者 以及它们为什么如此重要。 如果传粉昆虫不给植物授粉， 所有依靠这些植物生存的生物 包括我们自己就会被挨饿。 所以我将这些很酷的生物 组建成一个超级英雄团队。 （掌声） (跺脚声) （音乐） （大吼） 传粉者： 破坏森林的惧龙! 我就知道是你！ 我需要呼叫其它的传粉者们！ （音乐） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:06	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
所有我的动画都起源于创意， 但什么是创意？ 创意能激发行动。 创意意味着机会和创新。 创意是世界运转的源泉。 如果不是有创意， 我们就不会是现在这样 有科技、 医药、 艺术、 文化以及我们的生活方式。 八岁那年，我将我的创意付诸实践 开创了自己的生意，叫作“玛雅的创意” 和我的非盈利性组织-- “玛雅有关地球的创意”。 （笑声） 我制作环保材料的服装和配饰。 我现在 13 岁，尽管我在 2008 年开始了 我的生意， 我的艺术之旅在那之前很早就开始了。 艺术给予我极大地影响，我想要 把它纳入我所做的一切，甚至是我的生意。 我会在房子周围找寻不同的面料， 并说，"这可以是一条围巾或帽子。" 我有着很多设计灵感， 当我穿着我自己的作品时，我注意到 人们会暂住脚步问说， "哇，这真的很可爱。在哪儿能买到呢?" 我想，我可以开始自己的生意了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
那时我没有任何的商业计划， 也只有八岁。 我只知道我想要制作漂亮的饰品， 用对环境安全无害的材料和方式 我想要回馈自然。 我妈妈教我缝纫技术， 我坐在走廊后面， 用缎带制作发箍， 并写下产品名和价格。 我开始制作更多的饰品，像是帽子， 围巾和包袋。 很快，我的作品销往世界各地， 购买的客户来自丹麦、 意大利、 澳大利亚、 加拿大和其它国家。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
现在，我有学习更多商业知识， 像品牌塑造和市场营销， 同我的老客户沟通， 看看什么卖得最好， 什么销量最糟。 很快，我的生意真的开始飞黄腾达了。 然后有一天，《福布斯》杂志联系我， 那时我只有 10 岁。 （笑声） 他们想要写关于我 和我公司的文章。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:07	<br><br>
	
现在很多人问我， 为什么你的生意是环境友好型的？ 从小开始，我就有 保护环境和生活在其中的 小小生物的热情。 我很小的时候，父母就教给我 要回馈和善待环境。 我了解到，一些衣物的染料 或衣物的生产过程 对人类和地球是有害的。 所以我开始研究， 我发现甚至在染色完成后， 废弃的污水还会造成 环境污染。 例如，磨材料， 或倾倒干粉材料。 这些行为会污染空气， 对于人体和环境是有毒的。 所以，当我开始自己生意的时候， 两件事是很确定的： 我的作品必须是环保的， 利润的 10% 到 20% 要捐给当地和世界上的慈善机构 和环境保护组织。 （掌声） 我觉得我是新兴企业家的一部分 不单只追求建立一个成功的企业， 而且要建立一个可持续的未来。 我觉得可以满足客户的需求， 在不损害后代享有 更加绿色的未来的前提下。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:18	<br><br>
	
我们生活在一个广阔的、 多样的美丽世界， 这让我更有保护这一切的热情。 但只用头脑来想想， 我们的世界正在发生些什么 是远远不够的。 还要通过你们的心， 因为当你用心感受这件事， 就会有所行动。 那时，机会 和创新就会出现 这也就是为什么创意能成为现实。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:40	<br><br>
	
谢谢你，和平与祝福。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:45	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:50	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:53	<br><br>
	
帕特 ・ 米切尔： 玛雅谈到 在她背后支持她的令人赞叹的父母 他们在哪里？ 有请佩恩先生和夫人 ！ （掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Why massive open online courses (still) matter</a> </b><br>

2013 was a year of hype for MOOCs (massive open online courses). Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results. But the head of edX, Anant Agarwal, makes the case that MOOCs still matter ― as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement (but perhaps not replace) traditional classrooms. Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning, where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students. 	<br><br>

I'd like to reimagine education. The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word. It starts with an M. MOOC: massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world, in the millions, for free. Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it. Now, in this discussion today, I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs. We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:04	<br><br>
	
Now, our classrooms could use change. So, here's a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the Northeast of America, MIT. And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago, and this is a classroom today. What's changed? The seats are in color. Whoop-de-do. Education really hasn't changed in the past 500 years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. You know, from healthcare to transportation, everything is different, but education hasn't changed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:46	<br><br>
	
It's also been a real issue in terms of access. So what you see here is not a rock concert. And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Now, we've all heard of distance education, but the students way in the back, 200 feet away from the instructor, I think they are undergoing long-distance education. Now, I really believe that we can transform education, both in quality and scale and access, through technology. For example, at edX, we are trying to transform education through online technologies. Given education has been calcified for 500 years, we really cannot think about reengineering it, micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. It's like going from ox carts to the airplane. Even the infrastructure has to change. Everything has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises, online videos. We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification. We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards. Everything really has to change. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:07	<br><br>
	
So at edX and a number of other organizations, we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. And you heard of this example, where, when we launched our very first course -- and this was an MIT-hard circuits and electronics course -- about a year and a half ago, 155,000 students from 162 countries enrolled in this course. And we had no marketing budget. Now, 155,000 is a big number. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history. 7,200 students passed the course, and this was a hard course. 7,200 is also a big number. If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year, I would have to teach for 40 years before I could teach this many students. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. So today, I want to discuss a different aspect, the other side of MOOCs, take a different perspective. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom, to create a blended model of learning. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:22	<br><br>
	
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story. When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language. I call it teen-lish. It's a digital language. It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
Honey, come over for dinner. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
Hmm. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:54	<br><br>
	
Did you hear me? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:56	<br><br>
	
Silence. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
Can you listen to me? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
 Hmm.  	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
So we had a real issue with communicating, and we were just not communicating, until one day I had this epiphany. I texted her. (Laughter) I got an instant response. I said, no, that must have been by accident. She must have thought, you know, some friend of hers was calling her. So I texted her again. Boom, another response. I said, this is great. And so since then, our life has changed. I text her, she responds. It's just been absolutely great. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
So our millennial generation is built differently. Now, I'm older, and my youthful looks might belie that, but I'm not in the millennial generation. But our kids are really different. The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology. So why are we fighting it in the classroom? Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it. In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs, I can't text very well -- but I'm willing to bet that with evolution, our kids and their grandchildren will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs to text much better, that evolution will fix all of that stuff. But what if we embraced technology, embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections, and really think about creating these online technologies, blend them into their lives. So here's what we can do. So rather than driving our kids into a classroom, herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning, so why are we forcing our kids to do that? So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom, in the dining room, in the bathroom, wherever they're most creative. Then they come into the classroom for some in-person interaction. They can have discussions amongst themselves. They can solve problems together. They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions. In fact, with edX, when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world, this was happening unbeknownst to us. Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom, and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises, where the learners in the high school, 15-year-olds, mind you, would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class, and as you see from this image here, they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:33	<br><br>
	
We were also doing other pilots. So we did a pilot experimental blended courses, working with San Jose State University in California, again, with the circuits and electronics course. You'll hear that a lot. That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning. So there, the students would, again, the instructors flipped the classroom, blended online and in person, and the results were staggering. Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more, but the early results are incredible. So traditionally, semester upon semester, for the past several years, this course, again, a hard course, had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent every semester. With this blended class late last year, the failure rate fell to nine percent. So the results can be extremely, extremely good. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:26	<br><br>
	
Now before we go too far into this, I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas. What are some key ideas that makes all of this work? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:37	<br><br>
	
One idea is active learning. The idea here is, rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures, we replace this with what we call lessons. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises. So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise. Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education. You teach by asking questions. And this is a form of learning called active learning, and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972, by Craik and Lockhart, where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing. Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:21	<br><br>
	
The second idea is self-pacing. Now, when I went to a lecture hall, and if you were like me, by the fifth minute I would lose the professor. I wasn't all that smart, and I would be scrambling, taking notes, and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour. Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies, we offer videos and interactive engagements to students? They can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck, they can even mute the professor. So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
The third idea that we have is instant feedback. With instant feedback, the computer grades exercises. I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students? Your computer is grading all the exercises. And we've all submitted homeworks, and your grades come back two weeks later, you've forgotten all about it. I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days. Some are never graded. So with instant feedback, students can try to apply answers. If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback. They can try it again and try it again, and this really becomes much more engaging. They get the instant feedback, and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. In fact, one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year, he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year, and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark:  Oh god; have I missed you.  When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework? My colleague Ed Bertschinger, who heads up the physics department at MIT, has this to say about instant feedback: He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:21	<br><br>
	
The next big idea is gamification. You know, all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. You know, they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. So we applied these gamification techniques to learning, and we can build these online laboratories. How do you teach creativity? How do you teach design? We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs. So as this little video shows here, you can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here, the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:55	<br><br>
	
Fifth is peer learning. So here, we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook-like interaction not as a distraction, but to really help students learn. Let me tell you a story. When we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students, I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. I told my TAs, okay, 24/7, we're going to be up monitoring the forum, answering questions. They had answered questions for 100 students. How do you do that for 150,000? So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night, and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan, and he asked a question, and I said, okay, let me go and type up an answer, I don't type all that fast, and I begin typing up the answer, and before I can finish, another student from Egypt popped in with an answer, not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer, and before I can finish, a student from the U.S. had popped in with a different answer. And then I sat back, fascinated. Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were discussing and interacting with each other, and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated, having this epiphany, and by 4 a.m. in the morning, they had discovered the right answer. And all I had to do was go and bless it, "Good answer." So this is absolutely amazing, where students are learning from each other, and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:17	<br><br>
	
Now this is all not just in the future. This is happening today. So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world, from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- all over the world. And these kinds of technologies really help, the blended model can really help revolutionize education. It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs, the business aspect. We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities, and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs, where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next-generation textbook. They can use as much or as little as they like, and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:04	<br><br>
	
Finally, I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit. I would like us to really reimagine education. We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces. We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars. The Aakash is 40 dollars. We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:32	<br><br>
	
But I think at the end of the day, I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and, you know, you didn't even have a rewind button? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:58	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:00	<br><br>
	
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

我想要重新定义教育 去年 出现了一个新的四字单词 以M开头的缩写词 MOOC：大规模网络公开课 许多机构 陆续提供这些网络课程 免费提供给全世界数以百万计的学生 任何能够连接到因特网的人 如果想要学习这些课程，可以访问 这些名校名课 并在课程结束时获得专业证书 在接下来的讨论中 我会将话题集中在 网络公开课的另一面 我们大范围的吸收所学的知识 大范围的开发技术 却小面积的应用 创造了一种混合的教育模式 真正意义上地重新确立和重新定义 教室里的教学内容 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:04	<br><br>
	
我们的教室需要改变 这是一间教室 其所属的教育机构有三个字母组成 即美国东北部的MIT 这是五六十年代的一间教室 而这是目前使用的教室 有什么变化吗 座位有了颜色 呕吼 教育模式根本未曾改变过 过去的500年内 教育领域里最近的一个大革新 是印刷机和教科书 生活中一切其他的事物都在改变 从医疗业到运输业 一切都有所变化，但是教育领域仍保持原样 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:46	<br><br>
	
在是否有机会接受教育上，这也是个切实的问题 你看到的这张图片 不是什么摇滚音乐会 讲台中间的那个人 不是麦当娜 这是一间教室 位于尼日利亚的奥巴费米亚沃洛沃大学 我们都听说过远程教育 但是坐在后面的学生 离这位讲师有200英尺(61米) 我认为他们正在接受真正意义上的远距离教育 现在，我真的相信 我们可以转变教育模式 无论在质量上，规模上还是教育权利上 通过技术手段来转变 比如，在edX网站上 我们正试着改变教育领域 通过在线技术 鉴于这500年来，教育已经僵化 我们不能对它进行再造 和微观管理 事实上，我们需要彻底地重新定义 就像从乘牛车到坐飞机 即使要改变基础设施 要改变一切 我们需要从板书教育 转变成在线练习、 在线视频 我们要使用互动型虚拟实验室 和游戏化模式 我们应当完全在线评分 在线与同伴互动和在线讨论 的确，一切都要改变 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:07	<br><br>
	
所以在edX网站和一些其他的组织 我们将这些技术应用于教育 通过MOOCs，真正增加人们受教育的机会 大家应听说过这个事例 当时我们推出了第一档课程 麻省理工学院的 电路与电子技术课程 大约一年半以前 来自162个国家的155,000名学生 注册了这档课程 当时我们没有营销预算 155,000是个大数目 这个数字大于 麻省理工学院的校友总数 自其150年前建校以来 7,200 学生通过了这个课程 而且这个课程很难 7,200 也是个大数目 如果我在麻省理工学院任教每年两个学期 要40年 才能教到这么多学生 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
这些大数目 都只是故事的一部分而已 所以今天，我想讨论一个不同的方面 大规模网络公开课的另一面 以一个不一样的视角 我们将大量拓展和学习到的知识 应用在局部 到教室里来创建混合的学习模式 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:22	<br><br>
	
但在谈到那之前，我先讲一个故事 我女儿满13 岁时，步入少年时期 她讲的不再是英语 而是开始说这种新的语言 我称之为少年语言 它是一种数字式的语言 它有两种声音：咕哝声和沉默 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
“亲爱的，过来吃饭” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
“嗯” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:54	<br><br>
	
“听见我说的话了吗” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:56	<br><br>
	
沉默（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
“能听见我说话吗?” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
“嗯” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
因此，我们有一个沟通方面的切实问题 我们根本不是在沟通 直到有一天我才有此顿悟 我发短信给她（笑声） 得到一个即时的回应 我说，不，那肯定是偶然 你知道，她得想想 她的一些朋友在叫她 所以我再次给她发短信 再一次回应 我说，这太棒了 于是，从那时起，我们的生活已经改变了 我发短信 她回应 这种模式一直都非常好 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
我们的千禧一代 成长方式有所不同 现在，我老了，这一点与我年轻的外表并不相称 但我不是千禧一代 但我们的孩子真的不一样 千禧一代完全适应 在线技术 那么我们为什么不在教室里使用这种技术呢 不要再反对它，让我们接受它 事实上 我有两个肥胖的拇指 编辑短信并不容易 但我敢说，在进化的过程中 我们的孩子和他们的子孙 将发育成很小，甚至极小的拇指 以便更好地编辑信息 这种进化将改变诸如此类的东西 但如果我们使用在线技术 接受千禧一代 天生的优待 真正去创建这些在线技术 将其融入他们的生活，会怎样呢 这就是我们能够做到的 与其把孩子送进教室 让他们在早上8点钟赶到教室 我以前就讨厌在早上8点钟上课 所以我们为什么要强迫孩子们这样做呢 倒不如 让他们观看视频 做互动性的练习 在舒适的宿舍、卧室 餐厅、浴室 任何使他们最具创造力的场所 然后他们再来到教室 在人与人之间做一些真实的互动 他们可以相互讨论 可以一起解决问题 他们可以与教授合作 并且有教授解答他们的问题 事实上，当我们第一次将课程传到edX上时 让整个世界都能学到电路与电子技术这门课 并不知道会发生这样的事 两名高中教师 在蒙古国的桑特高中 已经转变了他们的课堂教学模式 他们使用我们视频讲座 和交互式练习 这所高中的学生 要知道，是15岁的学生 会在自己的家园做这些 会进入课堂 就像你看到的这幅图片 他们彼此进行交流 做一些物理实验 我们发现这些的唯一途径 就是通过他们写的博客 我们碰巧发现了这个博客 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:33	<br><br>
	
我们也在做其他的试验 我们做了一个试验性的混合实验课程 同加利福尼亚州的圣何塞州立大学合作 再一次关于电路与电子技术 你将多次听到这门课 该课程已成为 我们获取知识的培养皿 在那里，学生们会再次 在经过老师改造的课堂教学模式中 将在线教学和课堂教学相结合 结果令人吃惊 到目前为止这些结果还不够真实 还得等我们对此进行更长时间的试验 但早期的结果已经叫人觉得不可思议 用传统的教学方式，一个学期接一个学期 在过去几年里，这门课 这门难学的课 大约有40 %到41%的失败率 每个学期 去年年底的这种混合教学 将失败率降到9% 这种结果可以说是非常非常好 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:26	<br><br>
	
在我们深入探讨之前 我想花些时间讨论 一些核心观念 是什么样的核心想法 使这一切如此奏效 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:37	<br><br>
	
一个观点是主动学习 这个观点，不是说让学生 走进课堂，听讲座 而是用课程来代替 这类课程包括连续分节的教学视频 和互动练习 所以学生可能看一段五分钟或七分钟的视频 并按视频内容做互动练习 把它看做是终极的苏格拉底式教育 通过提问来教学 这是一种学习形式 叫做主动学习 早期文件显示，这种学习方法在1972年 经由克雷克和洛克哈特推行而兴起 他们提出并发现 学习和持久记忆 与大脑加工知识过程的深度大有关系 学生会学得更好 如果他们结合这些学习资料 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:21	<br><br>
	
第二个观点是自定步调学习 我一旦进入讲堂 如果你是像我一样 五分钟内就会跟不上这位教授 我不太聪明，我会焦急的记着笔记 然后余下的时间就跟不上了 相反，在线教学技术不是很好吗 我们为学生提供视频和互动式参与 他们可以按暂停按钮 可以回放课程 甚至，他们可以消音 这种自定步调的学习形式 非常有助于学习 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
第三个观点是即时反馈 有了即时反馈 计算机可以为练习评分 不然你要怎么教十五万学生 您的计算机会对所有练习打分 我们都曾提交过作业 你的成绩会在两周后反馈回来 那时你已经忘了作业内容 我认为我不会再收到 一些本科时期的作业 一些永远不会评分的作业 有这样的即时反馈 学生可以试着填上答案 如果做错了，他们可以获得即时反馈 他们可以一次又一次的尝试 这个过程更加迷人 他们得到的即时反馈 就是你看到的这个小小的绿色复选标记 它成了edX上令人痴迷的符号 学习者告诉我们他们晚上上床睡觉 都做着绿色对号的梦 事实上，有一名学习者 去年年初学习了那门电路课程 接着，他又修了一门伯克利大学的软件课程 就在同年年底 这位学习者 在讨论板上提到 他刚刚开始学那门课的时候 关于绿色的复选标记的想法： “天啊，我是那么的想念你” 你最后一次见到学生 对家庭作业发表如此评论是什么时候 我的同事 Ed Bertschinger 担任麻省理工学院物理系的主任 曾对即时反馈有这样的说法： 他表示，即时反馈 使教学时刻即时体现出学习成果 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:21	<br><br>
	
另一个伟大的理念是游戏化模式 所有学习都者都能很好的利用 互动式教学视频等等 他们会整天坐在那拍摄 外星人的宇宙飞船，直到他们拍摄到 所以我们可以将这些游戏化的技术应用到学习中 我们可以建立在线实验室 你如何教会学生发挥创造力？ 你如何教学生学习设计? 我们可以通过在线实验室来实现 使用计算机 建立这些在线实验室 就像这个小小的视频所显示的一样 您可以吸引学生的注意力 就像他们用乐高进行设计 在这儿，学习者正在构建一个电路 像玩乐高一样轻松 这也可以由计算机来打分 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:55	<br><br>
	
第五点是同伴学习 所以，我们使用论坛讨论 还有类似脸书的互动 不为消遣 而是真正有助于学生学习 给大家讲一个故事 当我们的电路课程 要为那155,000 的学生上线时 我连着三个晚上没睡觉 引领课程上线 我每时每刻都在告诉我的助教们 人数会上涨的 监测论坛 回答问题 他们解答了100 名学生提出的问题 面对15万学生要怎么办 一天晚上我坐在那，凌晨两点钟 思考一个 巴基斯坦的学生提出的问题 他问了一个问题 我想 好吧 就去键入一个答案吧 我可以慢点写 然后我开始键入答案 还没写完 另一名埃及的学生就弹出了一个答案 不完全正确 所以我就完善了一下 我还没有改完 又有一个来自美国的学生 突然弹出了一个不同的答案 然后我坐回去，被吸引住了 砰 砰 砰 砰 学生之间 相互讨论交流 那天凌晨四点 我完全入迷了 他们渐渐顿悟 到早上4点钟 他们发现了正确的答案 我能做的就是去赞美一下 "答得好" 这太让人惊讶了 学生之间彼此学习 这告诉我们他们是 因教而学 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:17	<br><br>
	
这一切不是只存在于未来 今天也同样在发生 所以我们将这些混合学习模式试验应用到 世界各地的一些大学和高中 从中国的清华大学 到蒙古的蒙古国立大学 到加州的伯克利大学 到整个世界 这种类型的技术 这种混合教学模式可以真正帮助 改革教育领域 它也能解决大规模网络公开课的实际问题 在其商业方面 我们还可以授权这些网络公开课 面向其他的大学 其中蕴藏着MOOCs的收益模式 那些授权使用的大学 其任课教授 可以使用这些在线课程 就像下一代的教科书 他们可以想用多少就用多少 它就是老师武器库中的一个工具 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:04	<br><br>
	
最后，我想要大家 与我一起想象一小会儿 我希望能够真正重新定义教育 我们将会有从讲堂转移到电子空间 我们要从使用书本转移到使用平板电脑 就像印度的Aakash平板电脑 或20美元的树莓派电脑 Aakash平板售价40美元 我们要从砖泥构筑的学校建筑转移到 数字化房间 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:32	<br><br>
	
但我想终有一天 我们仍然需要一个课堂 保留在大学里 否则我们要怎样告诉我们的子孙 你们的爷爷奶奶当初就坐在那个房间里 一排一排整齐的就像田里的玉米杆 然后在后排看着教授 讲授知识 知道吗 你根本没有后退键可以按 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
谢谢 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:58	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:00	<br><br>
	
谢谢 谢谢（掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Why do people feel so miserable and disengaged at work? Because today's businesses are increasingly and dizzyingly complex ― and traditional pillars of management are obsolete, says Yves Morieux. So, he says, it falls to individual employees to navigate the rabbit's warren of interdependencies. In this energetic talk, Morieux offers six rules for "smart simplicity." (Rule One: Understand what your colleagues actually do.) 	<br><br>

I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas: Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work? I have worked with more than 500 companies. Despite all the technological advances -- computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications, the Internet. Enigma number two: Why is there so little engagement at work? Why do people feel so miserable, even actively disengaged? Disengaging their colleagues. Acting against the interest of their company. Despite all the affiliation events, the celebration, the people initiatives, the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams. 	<br><br>

At the beginning, I thought there was a chicken and egg issue: Because people are less engaged, they are less productive. Or vice versa, because they are less productive, we put more pressure and they are less engaged. But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates, in fact, to the basic pillars of management. The way we organize is based on two pillars. The hard -- structure, processes, systems. The soft -- feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality. And whenever a company reorganizes, restructures, reengineers, goes through a cultural transformation program, it chooses these two pillars. Now, we try to refine them, we try to combine them. The real issue is -- and this is the answer to the two enigmas -- these pillars are obsolete. Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination. They are obsolete. How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business? The hard approach, basically is that you start from strategy, requirements, structures, processes, systems, KPIs, scorecards, committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters, you name it. I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, middle offices and interfaces. What happens basically on the left, you have more complexity, the new complexity of business. We need quality, cost, reliability, speed. And every time there is a new requirement, we use the same approach. We create dedicated structure processed systems, basically to deal with the new complexity of business. The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization. 	<br><br>

Let's take an example. An automotive company, the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix. If you open any cell of the matrix, you find another 20-dimensional matrix. You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption, Mr. Anti-Collision Properties. For any new requirement, you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement. What happens when the new requirement emerges? Some years ago, a new requirement appeared on the marketplace: the length of the warranty period. So therefore the new requirement is repairability, making cars easy to repair. Otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light, if you have to remove the engine to access the lights, the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours, and the warranty budget will explode. So, what was the solution using the hard approach? If repairability is the new requirement, the solution is to create a new function, Mr. Repairability. And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process. With a repairability scorecard, with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive. That came on top of 25 other KPIs. What percentage of these people is variable compensation? Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs, repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent. What difference did it make in their actions, their choices to simplify? Zero. But what occurs for zero impact? Mr. Repairability, process, scorecard, evaluation, coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact. 	<br><br>

Now, in front of the new complexity of business, the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines. It is basically the interplay. How the parts work together. The connections, the interactions, the synapses. It is not the skeleton of boxes, it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence. You know, you could call it cooperation, basically. Whenever people cooperate, they use less resources. In everything. You know, the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. When you design cars, please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages. When we don't cooperate we need more time, more equipment, more systems, more teams. We need -- When procurement, supply chain, manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock, more inventories, more working capital. Who will pay for that? Shareholders? Customers? No, they will refuse. So who is left? The employees, who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. Stress, burnout, they are overwhelmed, accidents. No wonder they disengage. How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation? The hard: In banks, when there is a problem between the back office and the front office, they don't cooperate. What is the solution? They create a middle office. What happens one year later? Instead of one problem between the back and the front, now I have two problems. Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front. Plus I have to pay for the middle office. The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation. It can only add new boxes, new bones in the skeleton. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:35	<br><br>
	
The soft approach: To make people cooperate, we need to make them like each other. Improve interpersonal feelings, the more people like each other, the more they will cooperate. It is totally wrong. It is even counterproductive. Look, at home I have two TVs. Why? Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife. (Laughter) Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife. And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife. If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough: You will watch my favorite football game, if you are not happy, how is the book or the door? (Laughter) The more we like each other, the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs. And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration. Definitely, these approaches are obsolete. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system, we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules. Simple rule number one: Understand what others do. What is their real work? We need to go beyond the boxes, the job descriptions, beyond the surface of the container, to understand the real content. Me, designer, if I put a wire here, I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights. Second, you need to reenforce integrators. Integrators are not middle offices, they are managers, existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate. How can you reinforce your managers as integrators? By removing layers. When there are too many layers people are too far from the action, therefore they need KPIs, metrics, they need poor proxies for reality. They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs. By removing rules -- the bigger we are, the more we need integrators, therefore the less rules we must have, to give discretionary power to managers. And we do the opposite -- the bigger we are, the more rules we create. And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules. You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment, their intelligence. You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate, to move out of insulation. Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage. These rules, they come from game theory and organizational sociology. You can increase the shadow of the future. Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions. This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact. They said to the design engineers: Now, in three years, when the new car is launched on the market, you will move to the after sales network, and become in charge of the warranty budget, and if the warranty budget explodes, it will explode in your face. (Laughter) Much more powerful than 0.8 percent variable compensation. You need also to increase reciprocity, by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient. When you remove these buffers, you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear. We will cooperate. Remove the second TV. There are many second TVs at work that don't create value, they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency. You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate. The CEO of The Lego Group, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it. He says, blame is not for failure, it is for failing to help or ask for help. It changes everything. Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses, my real forecast, because I know I will not be blamed if I fail, but if I fail to help or ask for help. When you do this, it has a lot of implications on organizational design. You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines; you look at their interplay. It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use. On human resource management practices. When you do that, you can manage complexity, the new complexity of business, without getting complicated. You create more value with lower cost. You simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both. Complicatedness: This is your battle, business leaders. The real battle is not against competitors. This is rubbish, very abstract. When do we meet competitors to fight them? The real battle is against ourselves, against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness. Only you can fight, can do it. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

近几年， 我都在尝试解开两个谜： 为什么在所有我工作过的公司 生产力都如此令人失望？ 我和超过 500 家公司打过交道 尽管（这些公司有）所有的技术进步 ― ― 计算机、 信息技术、 通讯、 电信、 和互联网 第二个谜： 为什么（员工）在工作中的投入这么少？ 为什么人们觉得如此难受， 甚至主动抽离出来呢？ 疏离他们的同事， 和其公司的利益背道而驰， 不管（公司安排）了多少归属活动， 庆典，以人为本的倡议， 用以培训管理人员更好地激发他们的团队 的领导力发展项目 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
一开始，我以为这是个 “鸡和蛋”的问题： 因为不投身于工作的人，生产力会相对低下 反之亦然，因为他们生产力较低， 承受了更多压力，以致他们较不投入工作 但是当我们进行了分析， 我们意识到这两个问题的根源是一致的， 我们意识到这两个问题的根源是一致的， 事实上，这涉及到管理的基本支柱 我们组织的方式基于两大支柱： 硬性支柱 ― ― 结构、 进程、 系统 软性支柱 ― ― 感情、 情绪、 人际关系、 性状、 人格 每当一家公司 整顿、 重组，重新设计， 或进行文化转型的项目， 都要选择这两个支柱 现在，我们试着完善它们， 我们试着将它们合并 真正的问题 ― 正是那两个谜题的谜底 ― 这些支柱是过时的 商务书籍中看到的一切，都是基于 这个支柱或那个支柱， 或它们的组合 它们已经过时了 当你面对新的复杂型业务，试着使用这些方法时， 当你面对新的复杂型业务，试着使用这些方法时， 这些方法是如何运行的？ 硬件方式基本上是这样开始：战略、 要求、 结构、 流程、 系统、 关键绩效指标、 记分卡、 委员会、 总部、 枢纽、 群体 随你说吧 我忘了说那些测量方式、 激励措施、 委员会、 中间办事处和接口 基本上都在图的左边（文：战略，要求） 你面对更多的复杂性，新业务的复杂性 我们需要质量、 成本、 可靠性、 速度 然而每一次有一项新要求 我们都使用相同的方法 我们创建专用的结构处理系统 以解决新业务的复杂性 硬性办法在组织内产生的只有复杂性 硬性办法在组织内产生的只有复杂性 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:54	<br><br>
	
让我们看一个例子： 一家汽车公司，工程部 是一个五维矩阵 如果您打开的矩阵的任意一个元素， 您可以找到另一个20维矩阵 你有“噪音先生”，”汽油消耗先生”， “防撞性能先生” 对任何新的要求， 你有一个专用的职能 负责把工程师对应到 新的规定上 当新规定出现时，会发生什么呢？ 几年前，一个新的要求 在市场上出现― “保修期的长度问题” 因此新的要求就是（提高）修理的易度， 使汽车容易修复 不然，当你把车开到修车厂来修灯， 如果你要拆除引擎 才能修理车灯 这辆车将不得不在车库里呆上一周 而不是两个小时 那么保修预算就会不够用 那么，如何使用硬件方法来解决这个问题呢？ 如果“修理易度”是新的要求 解决方案是创建一个新的职能 叫它“修理易度先生” “修理易度先生”建立一个“修理易度“进程 利用“修理易度”记分卡与“修理易度”矩阵 还有最终的”修理易度“激励 位居其它25个关键绩效指标之上 这些人中有多少比例领取可变薪酬呢？ 最多有20%，除以26个关键绩效指标， 修理易度只占有0.8%的重要性 这是否影响了员工的行为？ 影响了他们选择简化流程？完全没有 但为了这个不存在的影响，发生了多少事？ “修理易度”先生、 生产过程、 记分卡、 评价、 协调，还有其他25个协调员 最终没有任何影响 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:35	<br><br>
	
现在，面对新的复杂型业务， 唯一的解决办法不是条条框框 和报告路线 而是相互作用 各种路径如何在一起工作 （包括那些）连接、 互动、 突触 它不是条框的骨架，它是应性和智慧的 中枢神经系统 你知道，你可以就叫它合作 每当人们进行合作， 他们使用更少的资源，包括一切资源 你知道，修理易度的问题 就是合作的问题 当你设计汽车时，请你考虑一下 那些在售后车库修理汽车的工人的需求 那些在售后车库修理汽车的工人的需求 当我们不合作，我们需要更多的时间 更多的设备、 更多系统、 更多的团队 我们需要 ― ― 当采购、 供应链、 制造互相不合作 我们就需要更多股票，更多的库存，更多的周转资金 谁将为此付出代价呢？ 股东吗？客户吗？ 不，他们会拒绝 那么还剩谁呢？ 雇员们 他们必须以加倍的个人努力 来补偿所缺乏的合作 压力、 职业倦怠，他们不堪重负，意外事故（频发） 难怪他们无法投身于工作中 如何促进硬件和软件方式的合作？ 硬性办法： 在银行里， 当后台办公室和前台之间出现问题， 他们不合作。解决方案是什么呢？ 他们创建了一个中间办公室 一年后会发生什么呢？ 以前只有一个问题，在前台和后头办公室 现在我有两个问题： 后台与中间（的问题）， 还有中间和前台之间（的问题） 再加上要付中间办公室的费用 硬性办法不能促进合作 它只会加上新框框，在骨架中加入新的骨头 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:35	<br><br>
	
软性办法： 若要使人合作，我们需要让他们喜欢对方 改善人与人之间的感情 人们越喜欢对方，他们就会越合作。 这是完全错误的 它甚至会适得其反 瞧，我有两台电视在家里。为什么呢？ 正是为了不需要和我的妻子合作 （笑声） 不需要让我的妻子（在我和电视之间）选择 我不想逼我的妻子选择 正是因为我爱我的妻子 如果我不爱我的妻子，一台电视就足够： 你就看我最喜欢的足球赛， 如果你不高兴，不如看本书或者走人吧？ （笑声） 我们越喜欢对方， 我们就越避免真正的合作 艰难的权衡会使我们的关系紧张 所以我们去买第二台电视，或者我们 让更权威的机构定夺 当然，这些方法已经过时 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
为了应对复杂性，为了改善一种新型系统， 我们创建了我们称之为”智能简化“的方法 它基于一些简单的规则 第一条简单的原则： 了解其他人做的是什么 人们真正的工作是什么？ 我们需要超越条条框框、 工作说明，超越表层， 以理解真实的内容 我，设计者，如果我把一根导线放在这里， 我知道这将意味着我们将不得不 拆除引擎才能修理到灯 第二，需要加固联系枢纽 联系枢纽不是中间的办事处，他们是管理人员， 对现有管理人员进行加强 让他们有权力，有动力 让其他人进行合作 你如何能把您的经理训练为联系枢纽？ 通过消除阶层 当有太多阶层时， 人离实际行动太远， 所以他们需要业绩指标，矩阵， 他们需要空洞的指标来代替现实 他们不了解现实 同时他们增加了矩阵指标的复杂性 通过去除规则 ― 组织越是大 我们越需要联系枢纽， 因此我们必须有更少的规则， 把权力分给管理人员 但我们却做了相反的事 ― ― 组织越是大，我们却创造了更多的规则 最终我们有了大英百科全书一样的规则 我们需要增加权力的数量 从而可以让每个人有权利 使用他们的判断、他们的智力 我们必须给大家手里放入更多的”牌“ 给他们足够的”牌“ 让他们愿意需承担合作的风险 走出阻隔 否则，他们将会退出。他们将会抽离 这些规则，他们来自博弈论 和组织社会学 您可以增加未来的阴影 建立反馈循环，暴露 人们行动的后果 这是汽车公司所做的 当他们看到”简易度先生“并没有产生影响， 他们对设计工程师说: 三年后，在新车上市时 你将移到售后网络，并负责 保修期内的修理预算 如果保修预算透支 你就没好日子过（笑声） 这可比0.8%可变薪酬厉害得多 您还需要增加互惠原则 去除使我们能自给自足的缓冲区 当你把这些缓冲区拿掉 你我唇亡齿寒 我们将进行合作 拿掉第二个电视... 在工作有很多的第二个电视 他们不创造价值 它们只是提供功能失调的自给自足 我们需要奖励那些合作的人 并指责那些不合作的人 乐高集团的首席执行官 乔根・魏・诺斯托（Jorgen Vig Knudstorp） 就有不错的应用方法 他说，被指责的不应是失败 应该是不寻求帮助 这改变了一切： 突然间，将我的弱点和预测透明化 变得对我有益 因为如果失败了，我知道我不会受到责备 但如果我不寻求帮助，我会被责备 当你这样做时，对组织设计 有很大的意义 你停止画框框、 虚线、直线 你看着他们相互作用 它对我们的财政政策有很大的意义 它对我们的财政政策有很大的意义 它影响到人力资源管理的实践 当你这样做时，你可以管理复杂性 新的复杂型业务 而不需要弄得复杂 你能够以较低成本创造更多价值 同时提高了工作表现和工作满意度 因为你已删除了 阻碍两种复杂性的根源 这是你们这些商界领袖的战争 真正的战斗不是对抗竞争对手 这是废话，非常的抽象 我们什么时候和竞争对手见面，和他们打？ 真正的战斗是对抗我们自己 针对我们的官僚作风，我们的复杂性 只有你才能打倒它们，只有你才能做到 谢谢大家！ （掌声） 	<br><br>

More and more, English is a global language; speaking it is perceived as a sign of being modern. But ― what do we lose when we leave behind our mother tongues? Suzanne Talhouk makes an impassioned case to love your own language, and to cherish what it can express that no other language can. In Arabic with subtitles. 	<br><br>

Good morning! Are you awake? They took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you, did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic? Anyone! No one? All right, no problem. Once upon a time, not long ago, I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said, "Do you have a menu (Arabic)?" He looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard. He said, "Sorry? (English)." I said, "The menu (Arabic), please." He replied, "Don't you know what they call it?" "I do." He said, "No! It's called "menu" (English), or "menu" (French)." Is the French pronunciation correct? "Come, come, take care of this one!" said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself, "If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!" What's the meaning of saying "menu" in Arabic? Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way? At that moment, I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts! I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country? Where could this happen? How did we get here? Well, while we are here, there are many people like me, who would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past, just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture, thoughts, intellect and all my memories? Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war! Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? To be one of them? Where's the logic in that? Despite all that, I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science, research, a language we're used to in universities, a language we use in the workplace, a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project, and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it, then? We could all ask this question! So, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so? This is one reality. But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. How? Gibran Khalil Gibran, when he first started writing, he used Arabic. All his ideas, imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up, smelling a specific smell, hearing a specific voice, and thinking a specific thought. So, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English, when you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell, sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English, the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So, this is an example no one can argue with. Second, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill a nation, is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them? All right, we aren't from the developed world, this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet, and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development, do research, and catch up with those countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia and others, they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder, protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers, clueless consumers, like we are most of the time. So, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language. If I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic)," what does this remind you of? It doesn't ring a bell, does it? Regardless of the who, how and why. Language isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives, and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence," each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind, there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. Language isn't one, two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think, and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect? How do you say whether this guy understands or not? So, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English)," or if your son came up to you and said, "Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?" How would you feel? If you don't see a problem, then I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain. The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said, "Everything is fine, but once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him." (Laughter) (Applause) The poor woman had mistakenly told him "toqborni," and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought: "How could anyone be this cruel? Does she want to commit suicide? 'Bury me?' (English)" This is one of the few examples. It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband, since he won't understand, and he's right not to; his way of thinking is different. She said to me, "He listens to Fairuz with me, and one night, I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz." The poor woman tried to translate this for him: "From them I extended my hands and stole you --" (Laughter) And here's the pickle: "And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you." (Laughter) Translate that for me. (Applause) So, what have we done to protect the Arabic language? We turned this into a concern of the civil society, and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me, "Why do you bother? Forget about this headache and go have fun." No problem! The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says, "I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West." We didn't say, "No! We do not accept this or that." We didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language. We say-- (Applause) We want to change our reality, and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So, "I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West" has hit the spot. Something very easy, yet creative and persuasive. After that, we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside, a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with "Don't kill your language!" written on it. Why? Seriously, don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity. We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of "cool" guys and girls. We are very cool! And to whoever might say, "Ha! You used an English word!" I say, "No! I adopt the word 'cool.'" Let them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying "Internet" I wouldn't say: "I'm going to the world wide web" (Laughs) Because it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want. Creativity is the idea. So, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on, we can be creative. At this moment, every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution! But we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists, that we have a duty to be part of that solution. In conclusion, what can you do today? Now, tweets, who's tweeting? Please, I beg of you, even though my time has finished, either Arabic, English, French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers! (Applause) It's a disaster! That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do. Second, there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born, I'll tell her, "This is your father, honey (Arabic)." I wouldn't say, "This is your dad, honey (English)." And in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor, that if she says to me, "Thanks (Arabic)," I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'" and hope no one has heard her.

早上好！ 你们醒了么？ 他们刚拿走了我的胸卡，不过我想问问你们 胸卡上的名字， 有没有人是用阿拉伯语写的？ 有么？没有？恩，很好，没问题。 就在不久之前， 我和朋友坐在餐厅里，正要点餐。 我看着服务员，对他说， “有菜单么？” （用阿拉伯语） 他奇怪地盯着我看，以为他听错了。 他(用英文)说：“Sorry？” 我又说：“请给我菜单好么？” （用阿拉伯语） 他回答：“你难道不知道（菜单的）叫法么？” “我知道。” 他说，“应该叫Menu，或者Menu” （前者英文发音，后者是法文发音） 我的法语发音对么？ “过来，过来，这桌交给你了” 那个服务员说。 他明显不屑于和我说话， 然后他自言自语道， “就算世界上只有这一个女人， 我都不会正眼看她一眼。” 用阿拉伯语说“菜单”意味着什么？ 这两个字让黎巴嫩的青年男子认为，说这话的女人，又封建 又无知。 她怎么说得出这种话？ 从那一刻起，我开始思考这件事。 这件事让我很生气， 而且非常伤人。 我在自己国家，说自己语言的权利被否定了？ (世界上)还有什么地方会发生这种事？ 我们怎么会走到这一步的？ 不过，今天这个场合， 很多人和我一样， 到达了人生中的那个阶段： 心不甘情不愿的，放弃过去的一切， 到达了人生中的那个阶段： 心不甘情不愿的，放弃过去的一切， 只有这样他们才觉得自己是现代人、文化人。 只有这样他们才觉得自己是现代人、文化人。 那我是不是也该把我自己的文化、思想、 智慧和记忆全部都忘掉？ 童年可能是战争中我们最美好的回忆了！ 我是不是该忘掉阿拉伯语，仅仅是随大流而已？ 变成他们中的一员？ 逻辑何在？ 撇开这些不谈， 我依然试图去理解那个人。 我不想用他那种残忍的标准， 反过来去评判他。 阿拉伯语确实满足不了今天的需要。 不是科学用的语言， 不是研究用语， 不是大学里用的语言， 不是工作场合的语言， 不是我们进行尖端研究时的用语， 而且绝对不是机场用语。 如果我们在机场这么说， 他们肯定当场要搜身了。 那我什么时候才能用到它呢？ 这个问题很值得深思！ 你告诉我，说阿拉伯语的场合， 哪里去找？ 这只是其中之一。 还有一个更重要的现实需要我们考虑。 阿拉伯语是我们的母语。 研究表明，要想掌握其他语言， 需要先掌握自己的母语。 掌握母语，是掌握其他语言的前提。 此话怎讲？ 纪伯伦・哈利勒・纪伯伦， （黎巴嫩诗人，旧译 哈里利・吉布兰） 他最初写作时用的是阿拉伯语。 他所有的灵感，想象力和哲学观 都来源于他小时候的乡村成长经历， 来源于故乡的气味， 那特别的声音， 还有独特的想法。 所以当他开始用英文写作时， 肚子里已经有足够的墨水了。 即便之后他用英文写作， 当你读他的英文作品时， 你能闻到一样的气味， 体味到同样的感觉。 你可以想象出用英文写作的他， 依然是那个从黎巴嫩山村里出来的小男孩。 这是个无可争辩的例子。 其次，人们经常说，如果要消灭一个民族， 唯一的办法 是消灭它的语言， 这是发达国家都认识到的事实。 德国、法国、日本、中国， 这些国家都意识到了这一点。 这也是为什么他们要立法保护本国语言 把语言当做神圣的东西看待。 这也是为什么他们在生产中使用母语， 并投入大量资金发展自己的母语。 相比之下，我们的做法更明智吗？ 好吧， 我们不属于发达国家 这种前卫的想法还没有传播到这里， 我们希望追赶上文明社会。 那些曾经和我们一样， 但谋求发展的国家， 它们进行研究， 并追上发达水平的， 比如土耳其、马来西亚等等， 它们不管走到哪里，都会带上自己的语言， 像保护钻石一样。 他们把母语紧紧带在身边。 因为如果你从土耳其买来的东西 标签上没有使用土耳其语 那就不是当地产品。 你不会相信这是当地产品的。 他们会变成这样的消费者， 和你我一样，一无所知的消费者。 所以，为了创新和生产， 他们必须保护自己的语言。 如果我说，“自由，主权，独立” （阿拉伯语） 这些词让你联想到什么？ 没有任何感觉，是么？ 不管让谁说都是一样的。 语言不只是对话时，从嘴里发出来的音而已。 语言代表了我们生活中不同的阶段， 也是连接我们感情的术语。 所以当我说， “自由，主权，独立” 每一个词都唤起了你脑海中的一副图片， 在某个时代背景下 存在某种特定的情感。 语言并不是单纯的把一个两个三个字放在一起。 语言直接关系到我们内心的想法， 我们对彼此的看法， 以及别人如何看待我们。 智慧是什么？ 你怎么判断，对方理解了没有？ 所以，如果我说，“自由，主权，独立” （英文） 或者如果你儿子走过来，对你说： “爸爸，你有没有经历过“宣扬自由”（英文）的那个时代” 你会怎么想？ 如果你不觉得这问题很严重， 那我今天全部都是白讲。 不如早点回去比较好。 我的观点是，“表述”能让人联想到特定的某件事。 我有一个说法语的朋友，嫁给了一个法国人。 我有次问她最近如何。 她说 “都还可以， 但有一次我花了一整晚的时间 试图向他解释“toqborni”这个词的意思” （字面意思：愿你把我埋葬） （其实是对钟爱之人的爱语。愿我走的比你早，因为我不能没有你。） （笑声） （鼓掌） 那可怜的女人不经意地对他说“toqborni”， 然后不得不花整晚的时间去解释。 而他完全无法理解： “这话也太残忍了” 她是想自杀吗？ “埋了我？” （英文） 这仅仅是一个例子而已。 这让我觉得她无法跟自己的老公解释这个词， 因为他无法理解， 这也是无可厚非的； 毕竟他的思路不同。 她告诉我， “他和我一起听Fairuz” （黎巴嫩歌手） 一天晚上， 我试着给他翻译歌词 让他也能理解我听Fairuz 时的心情。“ 那个可怜的女人试着翻译这句话： ”我伸长双手，把你从他们那里，偷过来“ （笑声） 还有更刺激的： ”因为你属于他们，我放开双手让你回去“ （笑声） 你倒是翻译一个给我看看。 （鼓掌） 所以，我们是怎么保护阿拉伯语的？ 我们把这个问题变成一个社会议题， 然后开展了一项保护阿拉伯语的运动。 即使很多人问我 “不觉得麻烦么？ 忘掉这个烂摊子，去享受生活吧” 没关系的！ 保护阿拉伯语的运动有一句口号， “我们从东面和你交谈，而你们从西面回应” 我们可没说，“不行！非要怎么怎么样不可！” 我们不这样做， 因为这么一来就没人会理解我们了。 当有人非要这样说时， 我自己都很讨厌这样的阿拉伯语。 我们说―― （鼓掌） 我们想要改变现状， 并确信存在一种方式， (用语言)反映我们梦想、灵感和日常生活。 就像我们的衣服，和我们的想法一样。 所以“我们从东面和你交谈，而你们从西面回应” 非常到位。 简简单单，有创造性，又有说服力。 之后我们开展了另一项运动， 在地面上放置大幅文字。 你在外面就能看到一个， 用黑色、黄色的胶带围起来， 写着“不要消灭你的母语！”。 为什么？ 我是认真的，不要消灭自己的母语。 我们真的不应该消灭自己的语言。 如果我们消灭了语言， 我们就必须去寻找另一种身份。 我们必须去寻找另一种存在形式。 我们必须重新开始。 这么一来， 失去的可不光是现代化机会而已了。 然后我们放出了男孩女孩穿着纹有阿拉伯文字的衣服。 很 酷 的男孩女孩的照片。 我们真的 酷 毙了。 至于那些说， “哈，你这不是用英文了么！” 我会说， “错！是我们搬用了cool这个词” 随他们怎么否认， 但这个词真的又好用 又贴切，找不到更好的了。 我还会继续说“互联网(internet)” 我不会说： “我要去上万维网(www)了” （笑声） 因为和时代不符了！ 我们还是不要自己开自己的玩笑了 但要做到这件事， 我们必须确信 不能让任何比我们强大的， 或是自认为有权利去控制我们说什么语言的人 来控制我们，把他们的感受和看法强加在我们身上。 创造性是关键。 即使我们没办法上太空， 或是造出火箭之类的， 我们还是有创造力的。 此时此刻，在座的每一个人都是有创意的。 母语中的创造性，才是出路。 就让我们从这一刻起开始吧 我们可以写一本小说 或是拍部微电影。 一本小说就能让我们重登世界舞台了。 足够让阿拉伯语回到世界的顶端。 所以说“没有办法”是不对的。 当然有办法！ 但我们要记得，既然解决的方法是有的， 我们就有责任成为其中的一份子。 所以说，你今天能做什么呢？ 现在，发微博，有人发微博了么？ 拜托，真的拜托你了， 因为我的时间快到了， 阿拉伯语，英文，法文，或者中文。 但请不要把阿拉伯和拉丁字母和数字混在一起写！ （鼓掌） 这么写也太糟蹋了 根本不是语言了。 你这是在用虚拟世界里的虚拟语言。 从这种(支离破碎的)状态再拼起来就很困难了。 这是我们能做的第一件事。 其次，还有很多事是我们能做到的。 今天我们在这里不是为了说服谁， 我们在这里是为了让大众理解，保护语言的重要性。 让我来告诉你们一个小秘密。 婴儿第一次认识父亲， 是通过语言来认识的。 当我的女儿出生时，我会告诉她， “宝贝，这是你爸爸”（阿拉伯语） 我不会说， “宝贝，这是你爸爸”（英语） 在超市里的时候，我跟我的女儿诺儿保证， 如果她用阿拉伯语对我说“谢谢” 我就绝对不会怕别人听到（我女儿这么说）， 然后用法文矫正：“要说谢谢,女儿”（法文） （鼓掌） 让我们一起摆脱文化上的崇洋媚外吧。 （鼓掌） 	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
Once the powerhouse of America's industrial might, Detroit is more recently known in the popular imagination as a fabulous ruin, crumbling and bankrupt. But city planner Toni Griffin asks us to look again ― and to imagine an entrepreneurial future for the city's 700,000 residents. 	<br><br>

By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. There was a housing collapse, an auto industry collapse, and the population had plummeted by 25 percent between 2000 and 2010, and many people were beginning to write it off, as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. By 2010, I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner, and I've spent my career working in other contested cities, like Chicago, my hometown; Harlem, which is my current home; Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey. All of these cities, to me, still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice, issues of equity, inclusion and access. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
Now by 2010, as well, popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit, and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city." I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein, to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine, and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title, "Can This Planner Save Detroit?" So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now, because obviously, it's completely absurd that a single person, let alone a planner, could save a city. But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis. So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit, and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:59	<br><br>
	
So we began our process in September of 2010. It's just after a special mayoral election, and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process, which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among Detroiters. We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process, and people came out from all over the city, including areas that were stable neighborhoods, as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. And most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent African-American population in the city at that time. So obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program, and people line up to mics to ask questions. Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:51	<br><br>
	
So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. Many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great-grandparents, who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated from the rural South to the industrial North, as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence, "The Great Migration." They came to Detroit for a better way of life. Many found work in the automobile industry, the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. The fruits of their labors would afford them a home, for many the first piece of property that they would ever know, and a community with other first-time African-American home buyers. The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well, up until about 1950, which coincides with the city's peak population at 1.8 million people. Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration, a migration to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 2000, the region grows by 30 percent. But this time, the migration leaves African-Americans in place, as families and businesses flee the city, leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. During that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010, the city loses 60 percent of its population, and today it hovers at above 700,000. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
The audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city with such depleted population. Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied, and that they can see several abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches. Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes. They can also see vacant property. They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties, like illegal dumping, and they know that because the city has lost so much population, their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising, because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:20	<br><br>
	
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale, because I know that sounds like a big number, but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. So the city is 139 square miles. You can fit Boston, San Francisco, and the island of Manhattan within its footprint. So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together, it looks like about 20 square miles, and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan, at 22 square miles. So it's a lot of vacancy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities, and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots, and they're starting community gardens, which are creating a great sense of community stewardship, but they're very, very clear to tell us that this is not enough, that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010 about what to do with the vacant property, and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening, or what we call urban agriculture. So many people would say to us, "What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland? It can provide fresh foods, and it can put Detroiters back to work too." When I hear that story, I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration rolling over in their graves, because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice moving from the South to the North to create a better life for their families, only to see their great-grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle, especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the American dream: steady work and a home that they owned. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:03	<br><br>
	
Now, there's a third wave of migration happening in Detroit: a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs. These folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new, entrepreneurial ideas and profit, so much so that former models can move to Detroit, buy property, start successful businesses and restaurants, and become successful community activists in their neighborhood, bringing about very positive change. Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch and bicycle company, deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit, and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand of Detroit's innovation. And they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods, we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises, and we have businesses relocating, and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all, a city that's under the control of an emergency manager, and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013, we released Detroit Future City, which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence -- not what it was, but what it could be, looking at new ways of economic growth, new forms of land use, more sustainable and denser neighborhoods, a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system, and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change. Three key imperatives were really important to our work. One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large, but the economy was too small. There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit, very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between 35 to 70 jobs per 100 people. Secondly, there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before, and urban agriculture, while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit, was not the only answer, that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new, productive, innovative, and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities, where still nearly 300,000 residents lived. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:53	<br><br>
	
So we came up with one neighborhood typology -- there are several -- called a live-make neighborhood, where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises, with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again, majority 82 percent African-American population. So they, too, could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses, so that it could be used for storm water management, for example, by using surface lakes and retention ponds, that created neighborhood amenities, places of recreation, and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. Or we could use it as research plots, where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils, or we could use it to generate energy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:57	<br><br>
	
So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola, like Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year, or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. The good news is, there is a future for the next generation of Detroiters, both those there now and those that want to come. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
So no thank you, Mayor Menino, who recently was quoted as saying, "I'd blow up the place and start over." There are very important people, business and land assets in Detroit, and there are real opportunities there. So while Detroit might not be what it was, Detroit will not die. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:37	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:39	<br><br>

在2010年，底特律已经成为 深陷危机的美国城市的代表。 （它的）房地产业崩溃了， 汽车工业垮了， 人口在2000年到2010年间 下降了25%， 许多人开始放弃这座城市， 因为它已经“荣升”美国萎缩城市的榜首。 在2010年，我承蒙克雷斯基基金会 和底特律市政府的邀请 来与他们一起领导一个城市规划项目， 为这座城市创造一个成果共享的未来。 我以建筑师和城市规划师的身份 参与这项工作， 其实我也曾经服务于其他有争议的城市， 如我的家乡芝加哥， 我现在的居住地哈莱姆， 还有华盛顿以及新泽西洲的纽瓦克。 于我而言，这些城市仍然有一系列 有待解决的问题，关乎都市正义、 社会平等、包容性以及社会资源的获得。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
同样也是在2010年， 流行设计杂志开始 仔细地研究像底特律这样的城市， 并用长达整期的篇幅来讨论“改造这座城”。 我的好友弗雷德 伯恩斯坦邀请我 参加《建筑师》10月刊的 访谈， 当我们看到出版杂志的标题： “这位规划师能拯救底特律吗?" 我和他都咯咯地笑了。 我的笑容中略带尴尬， 那是因为，很显然， 仅凭一个人的力量，尤其是一个规划师的力量 就想拯救一座城市，这是荒唐可笑的。 但同时， 我笑是因为我觉得这个标题蕴含了 一丝希望，那就是我们的职业 对帮助一个城市走出严重危机 有着重要的意义。 因此，今天下午我想花一点时间 来告诉大家我们的改造计划， 也就是改进底特律的方法。 我想通过展现底特律居民的意见来做到这一点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:59	<br><br>
	
我们的改造计划启动于2010年9月， 那时特别市长选举刚刚结束， 而且有消息传出，这座城市 即将接受改造。 这让底特律居民 感到焦虑和恐慌。 我们已经计划好要在这样的房间里召开一系列社区会议 向居民介绍改造计划。 全城各地都有居民前来， 不管是住在情况稳定的社区的 还是住在已经看到 空置现象的社区。 当时， 大部分的听众是 那占城市人口82%的非裔居民的代表。 显然，我们的会议有一个提问环节， 人们在麦克风前排起长队，准备提问。 许多人坚定地走到麦克风前， 双臂交叉在胸前，然后说： “我知道，你们想把我赶出自己的房子，对不对？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:51	<br><br>
	
这个问题真的很尖锐， 当时我们就这么觉得， 尤其是在你把这个问题与 一些底特律居民， 以及很多有类似经历的 居住于像底特律那样的中西部城市的非裔家庭 联系起来。 他们中的很多人向我们诉说 他们是 从祖父母或曾祖父母那里继承房子的， 他们的先辈就是那160万 从南方乡村迁徙到北方工业区的移民之一， 这些移民的形象被雅各布 劳伦斯 记录在油画《大迁徙》之中。 移民来到底特律，期待着更美好的生活。 他们中的很多人服务于汽车工业， 如，福特汽车公司；迪亚戈 里维拉在这幅壁画中 描绘这些故事。这幅壁画现藏于底特律美术学院。 他们的劳动成果给他们带来了一座房子， 对于很多人而言，这是他们拥有的第一处房产。 同时他们拥有了自己的社区，里面住的 都是首次置业的非裔美国人。 他们在北方的前数十年 都生活的很好，知道1950年左右， 那时底特律的居住人口达到了峰值 180万人。 也正是在这个时候底特律开始经历 第二波迁移大潮， 人们搬迁到城市的郊区。 在1950年到2000年之间， 底特律的城市面积拓展了30%。 但这一次，迁移大潮 把非裔居民抛在身后。 随着家庭和企业离开底特律， 城中变得人口稀少， 就业机会紧缺。 也就是在1950年到2000-2010年， （底特律的）城市人口下降了60%， 现在其人口大概是70万人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
当晚，出席会议并与我们交谈的听众 跟我们讲述了生活在一个人口 如此稀少的城市的感受。 很多人说，他们的房子是街区中为数不多的 有人居住的房子， 坐在自家的门廊里 就可以看见数座被遗弃的房子。 在 整座城市中，有8万座空置的房子， 也有空置的不动产。 居民开始看到有人在这些建筑里 从事非法活动，如非法倾卸。 居民们还意识到，由于城市人口锐减， 水费、电费、油气费都在上涨， 因为支付财产税的人变少了， 税金不足以维持这些服务的运营。 在底特律，还有大概1000块闲置土地。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:20	<br><br>
	
大家或许对这种规模没有概念， 因为我知道，这听起来是一个巨大的数字， 但大家只有看了城市地图才能真正明白它的含义。 底特律的城市面积为139平方英里。 你可以把 波士顿、三藩市 以及曼哈顿岛 拼入底特律的地域之中。 如果我们抽出所有空置的和被遗弃的房产 并把他们拼在一起， 它们的面积大约有20平方英里， 几乎等同于我们现在所在的 曼哈顿岛的面积， 曼哈顿岛的面积是22平方英里。 空置率实在是太高了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
某些听众 也会给我们讲一些他们 社区中的好消息： 社区中的居民团结起来 管理空置的土地。 他们开辟了社区花园， 这为他们创造了一种强大的社区服务精神。 但他们仍然很明确地告诉我们， 这仍不令人满意， 他们希望自己的社区 能够像先辈建城时那样繁荣。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
自2010年起，人们就有很多关于 如何处理空置房产的猜测。 很多人认为它们会被建设为社区花园， 或者是所谓的城市农业。 很多人对我们说： “把空地变为农业用地，这个主意如何？ 它既可以提供新鲜食物， 也可以给居民提供工作机会。” 当我听到这种说法时， 我总想象着大迁徙中的先民 会在坟墓中辗转反侧， 可以想象到，他们背井离乡， 从南方迁徙到北方， 是为了给家庭带来更好地生活， 而不是要他们的曾孙辈又回到田园牧歌的生活之中； 特别是，他们来到这座城市的时候， 很多人并没有受过高中教育， 有的甚至没有上过初中， 但他们仍然能拥有 美国梦的基本元素： 稳定的工作，以及自有的房产。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:03	<br><br>
	
如今，底特律又出现了 第三波迁移大潮： 文化企业不断进驻。 企业家们把同样的空置地块 和被遗弃的房屋 看做获取新的 创意和利润的机遇； 他们可以像旧有的模式那样， 迁入底特律， 购置房产，建立成功的 企业和饭店， 并在自己社区中成为成功的社区活动家， 带来积极的变化。 同样的，一些小型的制造企业 也正在认真考虑进驻底特律。 Shinola是一家高档手表 与自行车制造商， 它特意选址底特律， 理由是 他们被底特律闻名全球的创新能力所吸引。 他们也知道，他们可以充分利用 一批仍然精于工业制造的劳动者。 现在，我们看到社区服务精神 在社区中萌芽发展， 文化企业决定 迁入底特律，创建新公司， 并且，制造业也准备迁入， 但这一切都发生在一个 我们都熟知的大环境之中： 一位紧急状况下的负责人 正在管理底特律， 而就在这个7月，他根据联邦破产法第9章提出了破产申请。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
我们在2010年就启动了这个项目；到2013年， 我们推出了“未来底特律”项目， 这是我们的一个战略计划，以引导这座城市 走上更好、更繁荣、 更可持续的发展道路―― 这不是它过去的模式，而是它可以利用的模式； 我们审视了新的经济增长方式， 新的土地利用模式， 更加稳定而稠密的社区， 重新配置的基础设施和城市服务系统， 以及更大的空间让民间领袖 采取行动，实施变革。 对于我们的工作而言，有三个情况 是迫在眉睫的。 第一，这座城市其实不算很大， 但它的经济规模却是太小了。 在底特律，每一百人只有27个就业机会， 这与丹佛、亚特兰大、费城的情况大不相同， 它们每一百人就有35到70个就业机会。 第二，人们要接受一个事实， 我们不会用以往的方式 来利用所有的闲置地块， 即使在将来也不会。 我们习以为常的传统居住区 不会出现， 而且，尽管城市农业产出丰厚 且成功干预了底特律的危机， 它也不会是唯一的出路。 我们要做的是，关注那些 空置率很高 但仍有大量人口的区域， 那些居民年轻，有干劲，有创意， 可以为企业所利用； 这样，他们使仍有 将近30万人的社区更稳定。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:53	<br><br>
	
因此，我们提出了一种新的社区构想―― 其实我们设计了几种模式――被称为生活工作相结合的社区。 在那里，居民可以重新利用 废弃建筑， 并把它们改造为企业基地， 同时也可以再次着重强调 占82%的非洲裔居民。 因此，他们也可以把 他们以前在居住区外建立的企业带入居住区， 并把它们发展为更加繁荣的产业。 同时他们也可以购置房产，使得他们同时成为 自己所住社区中的 房产所有者以及企业所有者。 我们也在考虑 除了种植作物以外的土地利用方式， 希望把土地规划得 更具生产效率。 比方说，一些地块可通过建造人工湖和蓄水池 来建立雨水管理系统； 可以设立社区便利设施、 娱乐设施， 切实地提高 附近居民的生活水平。 或者，我们可以设立研究中心 来治理土壤污染， 又或者建立发电厂。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:57	<br><br>
	
因此，“大迁徙”先民的后代 既可以变成Shinola的精确制表工匠， 就像去年Shinola广告中的威利先生那样； 也可以自己建立 可以给Shinola这样的公司提供服务的企业。 好消息是：下一代的底特律人 依然有着光明的前途， 不管已经身在底特律的还是想来底特律的都是这样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
所以，梅尼诺市长，你的好意我心领了； 他曾说： ”我要先把底特律夷为平地再重新开始。“ 底特律仍有着十分重要的人群、 产业以及土地， 而且还有实实在在的机遇。 虽然底特律不会恢复它过去的模样， 但它也不会消亡。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:37	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">What I learned from Nelson Mandela</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us. Boyd Varty, a wildlife activist, shares stories of animals, humans and their interrelatedness, or "ubuntu" ― defined as, "I am, because of you." And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela, the human embodiment of that same great-hearted, generous spirit. 	<br><br>

I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him. 	<br><br>

I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature, and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories, and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories, stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news, and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place, I also know it to be a place where people, animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:53	<br><br>
	
When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration, and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye, and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. (Laughter) But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed, and then, in an old track suit and slippers, he would go for a walk around the garden. At night, I would sit with my family around the snowy, bunny-eared TV, and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa, one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa: peace, reconciliation, harmony. Through this act of immense open-heartedness, he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu." Ubuntu: I am because of you. Or, people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
If Mandela was the national and international embodiment, then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man, Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money, but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle, but it makes for über-resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea, but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being. He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching. And then one day we were out together, and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track, but for fun he turned and he began to follow it, and I tell you, I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rearview mirror, you'd see he'd stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, "Solly, you are pathologically helpful." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:33	<br><br>
	
When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment, Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast, and they said to Solly, on the side, they said, "Before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live." So we took them up to his house, and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife, who was learning English, was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying, "Hello, I love you. Welcome, I love you." (Laughter) And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero. It was a hot day, and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat, I took my shoes off, and I rolled up my pants, and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand, and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank, and its branches were touching the water, and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie, people in the audience would have started saying, "Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter) And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham! It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you, and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. (Laughter) Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time, I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches, and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us. He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg, picks me up a second time, walks me to a vehicle, and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
Now ― (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share, and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value, his animated, empathetic action in every moment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
Now although the root word is about people, I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her, I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet, for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank, and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants, looks like the arm in motion, and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly -- ears came forward, she had a full go of it and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards. And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her, and he propped his trunk underneath her, and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:08	<br><br>
	
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:48	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:50	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today, and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:43	<br><br>
	
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. (Laughter) And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you." I mean, that's just incredible humility. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic. You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went, things went well. But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
PM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:45	<br><br>
	
PM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:49	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
此刻的我只想表达内心的感觉 所以在切入主题之前 身为南非人的我要告诉你们 一位鼓舞我至深的人 几小时前去世了 纳尔逊 曼德拉(Nelson Mandela)毕生为自由奋斗 终告v躬尽粹 因此我以这场演说向他致敬 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:39	<br><br>
	
我的成长经历充满惊奇 从小就与动物相伴 因为我在南非东部的荒野中长大 在一个叫伦多洛兹(Londolozi)的保育区 我们家在当地经营生态游猎 已有四代之久 就我记忆所及 我的工作就是带人走进大自然 所以我觉得今天因缘际会 让我有机会 把我在大自然中的经验 在此分享 非洲是一处 人们可在星空下 围坐篝火边讲故事的地方 所以今天我要与各位分享的 是几段简单的「围炉夜语」 都与勇敢的好汉相关 我要讲的故事 不是新闻会播报的那种 非洲确实是个艰困的地方 但我也知道此处的 人类、 动物和生态系统 让我们见识了更紧密相连的脉络 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:53	<br><br>
	
我九岁的时候 曼德拉总统来我家住 那时他刚从27年的监禁中获释 还无法完全适应自己 突然变成全球注目的焦点 非洲民族议会的议员以为 在丛林中 他会有休养生息的机会 摆脱众人的眼光 而狮群确能有效吓阻 媒体和狗仔队 （笑声） 对年幼的我来说,当时的影响至关重大 我会送早餐到他床边， 之后穿着旧运动服和拖鞋 他会在花园里散步 晚上，我和家人则围坐在 画面有杂纹的天线电视旁 花园里那个沉默的身影 就是我们在电视上看到 那个被人海包围的人 晚间播出的是他获释的镜头 那时他正以非凡的仁心 为动荡分歧的南非 带来和平 曼德拉常说，坐牢的好处就是 有办法内省、思考 并在心中擘划 他最想为南非做的事情： 和平、 和解、 和谐 透过这种极为宽厚的胸怀 他后来注定要成为 南非当地所谓「ubuntu」的象征 意思是「是你造就了我!」 也可以说，若没有彼此 人无法成就自己 这不是新的概念或价值观 却是我最近认为 值得加以阐扬的理念 事实上有此一说，非洲人都相信 透过与他人的互动 我们得以体认 自己最深切的人性 我们现场就体现了Ubuntu 你们创造了这个场合 让我得以表达最真切的自己 没有各位，我不过是空房独语 尽管上礼拜我常这样做 但表现差多了! （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
若国内和国际性的Ubuntu代表是曼德拉 那关于这种价值 教我最多的是这个人 萨利 穆朗戈 (Solly Mhlongo) 萨利是在树下出生的 离我长大的莫桑比克的60 公里远 他向来不怎么富裕 但我遇过最富足的人当中 他是其中一位 萨利从小就为父亲照顾牛只 我无法体会自小放牧的生活 但这种成长环境造就顶尖的本领 他在游猎这行的首份工作 是修理游猎车(safari trucks) 至于在丛林长大的他怎么会这个 我无从得知，但他确实能修理 后来他转行到我们所谓的 栖地团队 也就是维持 保护区完善的一群人 他修整道路，复育湿地 也参与防堵盗猎 有天我们一起出去 他看到一只雌豹 留下的旧足迹 为了好玩，他转身追踪 我告诉你，从他循迹追踪的速度 我看得出来 这家伙是博士级的追踪者 如果你在保护区开车 与萨利擦身而过 抬头看一下后照镜 就会发现他往前开20或50米 就会停在路边 看看你有无不时之需 我所听过，针对他的唯一指控 就是我们的一位游客说: 「萨利，你乐于助人的毛病就是改不了!」 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:33	<br><br>
	
当我成为专业的 本地导览员时 萨利是我的追踪者 我俩团队合作 我们的第一批客人 是美东来的一个慈善团体 他们悄悄对萨利说： 「在我们出去看狮子和猎豹前， 我们想先看看你住的地方。」 所以我们就带他们去 他们到萨利家拜访时， 正好萨利的妻子 在家学英语 她正处于练习开门问候语的阶段: 「你好，我爱你。 欢迎，我爱你。」（笑声） 在我看来，非洲的美在于 住家虽小 但主人慷慨大气 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
话说从救我的那天后 我就把萨利当英雄 那天很热 我们在一条河边 由于太热，我脱掉鞋子 卷起裤管 走入水中 萨利仍待在岸边 清澈的河水流过沙滩 我们转身溯河而上 在前方几米处 岸边有棵树倒落河滨 枝干已没入水面 形成一片阴影 若是恐怖片 观众里会冒出这样的话： 「别去！不要啊!」（笑声） 果然，暗处有鳄鱼藏身 被鳄鱼袭击的话，首先感到的 是凶残的撕咬 一声巨响! 我感觉右腿被咬了 甩头拉扯，我一手攀住树干 这时鳄鱼也剧烈地摇晃我， 另一种生物想要吃你时 那感觉难以言喻 若要提倡素食，很少有比这效果更好的! （笑声） 岸上的萨利见我身陷险境 急忙转身赶来救我 这时鳄鱼再度摆头摇晃 并咬我 我发现河面一抹血迹 顺流而下 鳄鱼再度咬我时，我踢了一下 一脚深入鳄鱼喉咙，才松口 我攀上树枝 离开水面后，我回头一看 我被咬的那脚，膝盖以下 伤势惨不忍睹 除了骨折 肌肉组织也遭撕裂 我当机立断不要再看 我离开水面时 萨利也来到我们之间 水位较深的地方 他明白是怎么回事，包括我的腿伤 也知道我们之间 有一条鳄鱼 说来你也许不信，他毫不迟疑 就直接进入深水区 他涉水而来时，水位过腰 接着到我身边抓住我 当时我仍在鳄鱼的攻击范围内 抱起我后，他把我背在肩上 萨利的另一项特质就是极其强壮 他转身带我上岸 放下我后，他脱下衬衫 来包扎我的伤腿 然后再把我抱起 走到车上 并送我就医 我才大难不死 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
我不知各位认识的人当中 有多少即使知道水中有鳄鱼 仍愿冒险犯难 去帮你一把 但对萨利来说，这是稀松平常的道理 他是我在非洲的经历中 一个令人惊异的榜样 在群体关系更紧密的社会中 人们打从心底明白 彼此的幸福 是密切相关的 危险与痛苦一起承担 喜悦和成就也要共享 住所和食物也不例外 Ubuntu 就是要人敞开心房 与人分享 那天我从萨利身上学到的 正是Ubuntu的本质 他行动间总是活力充沛 且善体人意 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
虽然ubuntu的字根舆人有关 我也曾以为这是唯一的解释 直到我遇见这头 名叫猫王(Elvis)的母象 事实上，萨利给她取这名字 据他说是因为她的步伐 就像猫王的扭臀舞 她的后腿和骨盆先天严重变形 是从我们这个保护区的东边 另一个在她迁徙路径上的保护区来的 我第一次看到这头母象 一度认为她来日无多 然而，往后的五年 她都会在冬季回来 那时我们会因为在野外发现 她与众不同的足迹而兴奋不已 那足迹像是反向的括号 这时我们定会放下手边的事 前往她和所属象群 所在的地方 游猎车上的人看到「猫王」时 都洋溢着感情 就是这种亲切感 提醒了我一件事 即使是在城市长大的人 对自然界及其中的生物 仍会本能地感到亲切 直到那时我仍很讶异她能活下来 有天我们在这小水塘边遇到该象群 那水塘陷入地表 为首的母象喝水时，我在旁看着 然后她以大象优雅缓慢的动作转身 摆动的象鼻宛如挥舞的手臂 只见她奋力爬上陡峭的边坡 其他成员也转身跟进 我注视着年纪轻的「猫王」 开始为爬坡作好准备 她双耳明显前翻 奋力一试，爬至半途 腿力不济，又滑了下来。 于是她再试一次 但也是无功而返 就在她第三度尝试时 不可思议的事发生了 就在她爬到半途时 一只年轻的大象来到她身后 用象鼻托住她 然后把她送上岸 我还想到一件事 就是其他象群成员 其实也在照顾「猫王」 隔天我又观察到 带头的母象折了一根树枝 放进嘴里后 会再折一枝 扔在地上 我们那里的向导 一致认为 象群为顾及这头小母象 实际上减缓了行进速度 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:08	<br><br>
	
我从们身上得到的领悟 让我对ubuntu有更广泛的定义 我相信在神圣的荒野中 我们会有机会 看见自己最良善的特质 透过他人 我们可体认自身的人性 但所有地球生物也能让我们有此体悟 如果非洲有值得分享的地方 那就是更紧密共荣的社会 Ubuntu 确实是非洲的价值观 但我目睹这个价值的精髓 在此形成 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:48	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:50	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
帕特   米切尔(Pat Mitchell)： 博伊德(Boyd) 我们知道你自小 就认识曼德拉总统 今天你我都听到了那条新闻 大家同样深感难过又茫然 明白这对世界而言是一大损失 但我想知道你是否 还有其他要说的? 因为我们知道你在演讲前 才听到噩耗 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:43	<br><br>
	
博伊德 瓦提(Boyd Varty)：帕特 我很庆幸他终于解脱 毕竟他受尽折磨 不用说我也是五味杂陈 但我回想起无数情景 比如当他上奥普拉(Oprah)的谈话秀 还问她该集节目内容 （笑声） 奥普拉回答:「会跟你有关!」 我的意思是这问题多谦卑! （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
他是南非国父 而南非未来的路还很长 南非人曾称诸如此类的事叫「曼德拉奇迹」 他去看橄榄球比赛我们就赢了 他所到之处，万事如意 但我相信这奇迹将长伴我们 最重要的是 我们都背负他所坚持的信念 那不仅是我要尝试的 也是全体南非人想要做的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
帕特:你今天就做到了! 博伊德::喔,谢谢你! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:45	<br><br>
	
帕特： 谢谢你。 博伊德：非常感谢你。感激不尽! 	<br><br>

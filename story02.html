	<hr><br>
In 2013, international migrants sent $413 billion home to families and friends ― three times more than the total of global foreign aid (about $135 billion). This money, known as remittances, makes a significant difference in the lives of those receiving it and plays a major role in the economies of many countries. Economist Dilip Ratha describes the promise of these “dollars wrapped with love” and analyzes how they are stifled by practical and regulatory obstacles. 	<br><br>

I live in Washington, D.C., but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa, in India. My father was a government worker. My mother could not read or write, but she would say to me, "A king is worshipped only in his own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere." So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up. But I almost didn't go to college until an aunt offered financial help. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
I went to study in Sambalpur, the largest town in the region, where, already in college, I saw a television for the first time. I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies. When the opportunity came, I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket. In the U.S., I worked in a research center, part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics. And with the little I earned, I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
My story is not unique. There are millions of people who migrate each year. With the help of the family, they cross oceans, they cross deserts, they cross rivers, they cross mountains. They risk their lives to realize a dream, and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family, which has helped them before. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:20	<br><br>
	
There are 232 million international migrants in the world. These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth. If there was a country made up of only international migrants, that would be larger, in population, than Brazil. That would be larger, in its size of the economy, than France. Some 180 million of them, from poor countries, send money home regularly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
Those sums of money are called remittances. Here is a fact that might surprise you: 413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries. Migrants from developing countries, money sent to developing countries ― 413 billion dollars. That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money. And yet, you and I, my colleagues in Washington, we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid, while we ignore remittances as small change. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:36	<br><br>
	
True, people send 200 dollars per month, on average. But, repeated month after month, by millions of people, these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency. So India, last year, received 72 billion dollars, larger than its IT exports. In Egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the Suez Canal. In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP. And in poorer countries, smaller countries, fragile countries, conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline, as in Somalia or in Haiti. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:19	<br><br>
	
No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people. Remittances, unlike private investment money, they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country. They actually act like an insurance. When the family is in trouble, facing hardship, facing hard times, remittances increase, they act like an insurance. Migrants send more money then. Unlike development aid money, that must go through official agencies, through governments, remittances directly reach the poor, reach the family, and often with business advice. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
So in Nepal, the share of poor people was 42 percent in 1995, the share of poor people in the population. By 2005, a decade later, at a time of political crisis, economic crisis, the share of poor people went down to 31 percent. That decline in poverty, most of it, about half of it, is believed to be because of remittances from India, another poor country. In El Salvador, the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances. In Mexico and Sri Lanka, the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care. Migrants send money home for food, for buying necessities, for building houses, for funding education, for funding healthcare for the elderly, for business investments for friends and family. Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery or a wedding. And migrants also send money, perhaps far too many times, for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
Much as these flows do all that good, there are barriers to these flows of remittances, these 400 billion dollars of remittances. Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home. Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor. They will say, "Up to 500 dollars if you want to send, we will charge you 30 dollars fixed." If you are poor and if you have only 200 dollars to send, you have to pay that $30 fee. The global average cost of sending money is eight percent. That means you send 100 dollars, the family on the other side receives only 92 dollars. To send money to Africa, the cost is even higher: 12 percent. To send money within Africa, the cost is even higher: over 20 percent. For example, sending money from Benin to Nigeria. And then there is the case of Venezuela, where, because of exchange controls, you send 100 dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even 10 dollars. Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel. It all goes in suitcases. Whereever costs are high, money goes underground. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:44	<br><br>
	
And what is worse, many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country. Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific countries. So, is it that there are no options, no better options, cheaper options, to send money? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:05	<br><br>
	
There are. M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only 60 cents per transaction. U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction. And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering, even though there is little data to support any connection, any significant connection between money laundering and these small remittance transactions. Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses, especially those serving Somalia. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:58	<br><br>
	
Somalia, a country where the per capita income is only 250 dollars per year. Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia is larger than that amount. Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia. And yet, this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid, while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy, through regulations. Then there is the case of poor people from villages, like me. In the villages, the only place where you can get money is through the post office. Most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies. So, if I have to send money to my father in the village, I must send money through that particular money transfer company, even if the cost is high. I cannot go to a cheaper option. This has to go. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:04	<br><br>
	
So, what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home? First, relax regulations on small remittances under 1,000 dollars. Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering. Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money transfer company. For that matter, between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor. In fact, they should promote competition, open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did, like they did, in the telecommunications industry. You have seen what has happened there. Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis. They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost, while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:15	<br><br>
	
The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent. If we reduce costs to one percent, that would release a saving of 30 billion dollars per year. Thirty billion dollars, that's larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year. That is larger than, or almost similar to, the total aid budget of the United States government, the largest donor on the planet. Actually, the savings would be larger than that 30 billion because remittance channels are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment, fees that migrants pay, migrant workers pay to laborers who found them the job. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:11	<br><br>
	
I was in Dubai a few years ago. I visited a camp for workers. It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid. Workers were coming back from their grueling day of work, and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker. He was preoccupied that he is sending money home, he has been sending money home for a few months now, and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent who found him that job. And in my mind, I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance. The remittance arrives. She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent, while the children are looking on. This has to stop. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:04	<br><br>
	
It is not only construction workers from Bangladesh, it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem. A construction worker from Bangladesh, on an average, pays about 4,000 dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only 2,000 dollars per year in income. That means that for the two years or three years of his life, he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees. The family doesn't get to see any of it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:36	<br><br>
	
It is not only Dubai, it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world. It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers, it is workers from all over the world. It is not only men. Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize, through innovation, diaspora saving and diaspora giving. Migrants send money home, but they also save a large amount of money where they live. Annually, migrant savings are estimated to be 500 billion dollars. Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate. If a country were to come and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate, and then say that the money would be used for building schools, roads, airports, train systems in the country of origin, a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development. Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances, that's when you can actually sell it to them. You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving. I would love to invest in a bullet train system in India and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village. Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
Remittances empower people. We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper. And it can be done. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:45	<br><br>
	
As for myself, I have been away from India for two decades now. My wife is a Venezuelan. My children are Americans. Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen. And yet, I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth. I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time. My parents are not there anymore. My brothers and sisters have moved on. There is no real urgency for me to send money home. And yet, from time to time, I send money home to friends, to relatives, to the village, to be there, to stay engaged ― that's part of my identity. And, I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants and their struggle to break free of the cycle of poverty. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

我住在华盛顿特区 但我是在新河克拉， 印度奥里萨邦的一个小村庄长大。 我父亲是个政府雇员， 我母亲不会读书写字， 但她跟我说：“国王只有 在自己的王国里才被膜拜， 而诗人走到哪儿都受到尊敬。” 所以我就想长大后成为一名诗人。 但是我差点没上成大学， 直到一位姨妈出钱帮我。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
我去了萨姆巴尔普尔， 当地最大的城镇读书。 在那儿上大学的时候， 我才第一次看到电视。 那时我梦想去美国接受高等教育。 后来机会来了， 我借钱买了机票，横跨两个大洋， 兜里装了二十元美金就来了。 在美国，我一边在一家研究中心兼职， 一边上经济学的研究生课程。 虽然挣得不多， 我还是一边供自己上学， 一边寄钱回家给我父亲和我兄弟。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
我这样的绝不是唯一的。 每年有成百上千万的人移民。 通过家人的帮助，他们跨越大洋， 沙漠，河流，或者山脉。 他们冒着生命危险去实现一个梦想。 他们的梦想很简单，就是 能有一份不错的工作， 让他们能寄钱回家， 帮助他们的家人， 那些曾帮助过他们的人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:20	<br><br>
	
世界上有两亿三千二百万国际移民。 他们生活在一个 不同于他们出生地的国度。 如果有一个国家 全部由国际移民组成， 它的人口将超过巴西， 它的经济实力将超过法国。 其中一亿八千万的移民来自贫穷的国家， 他们按时寄钱回家。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
这些钱叫做移民汇款。 这样一个事实可能会让你大吃一惊： 4310亿美元， 去年一共有4310亿美元 由移民们寄到发展中国家。 来自发展中国家的移民， 寄到发展中国家的钱， 4310亿美元。 这个数字相当惊人， 它等于所有发展资助资金总和的三倍。 但是，你，我， 我在华盛顿的同事们， 我们不停地争辩， 讨论发展资助， 却把移民汇款当作小钱忽略了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:36	<br><br>
	
确实，人们平均每月寄两百美元。 但是，月复一月， 成百上千万的人在寄， 这些钱汇聚成一条条外币形成的河流。 印度去年收到了720亿美元， 超过它的IT出口额。 埃及收到的移民汇款达到 苏伊士运河上贸易额的三倍。 塔吉克斯坦， 移民汇款占GDP的42%。 在更穷，更小，或者正发生冲突的国家， 移民汇款就如同救命稻草， 比如说在索马里或海蒂。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:19	<br><br>
	
难怪这些资金流 会对经济和贫困人口带来巨大的影响。 不同于私人资助基金， 移民汇款不会 在国家一出现问题的时候就回流。 它们更像保险金。 当家人遇到麻烦， 碰到问题，遇到困难的时候， 它会增加，就像保险金一样， 移民们会寄更多的钱回去。 它们也不像发展资助基金， 那些必须经过正式的机构， 通过政府。 而移民汇款直接到达穷人手中， 到达家人手中， 通常还附带着商业建议。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
在尼泊尔， 1995年时穷人占人口总数的42%。 十年之后，2005年时， 当时尼泊尔正遇上政治危机，经济危机， 可是穷人的比例却降到了31%。 贫困人口的减少，大部分， 大约一半，是依靠 从印度，另一个穷国， 寄来的移民汇款 。 在萨尔瓦多， 儿童辍学率 在接受移民汇款的家庭中就比较低。 在墨西哥和斯里兰卡 儿童的出生体重 在接受移民汇款的家庭中较高。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
移民汇款是被爱包裹的钱财。 移民们寄钱回去买食物， 买必需品，建房子， 用于教育，老年人的医疗， 还有家人和朋友的商业投资。 遇到特殊情况， 移民们还会寄更多的钱， 比如手术或婚礼。 也许更多的时候， 遇上突如其来的葬礼， 他们因为无法参加而寄钱回去。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
虽然这些资金流动有这么多好处， 它们的流动却受到很多阻碍， 阻碍这四千亿美元的流动。 最大的障碍是 寄钱回家的高额费用。 现金传递公司收费的方式 就是在压榨穷人。 他们会说，五百美元以下， 我们固定收取30元的手续费。 如果你很穷，只能寄两百块钱， 你也得交30元的手续费。 寄钱的全球平均花费是8%。 也就是说你寄100块钱， 到了另一边你的家人只能收到 92块。 寄钱到非洲的花费就更高： 12%。 在非洲内部寄钱， 费用还要更高： 超过20%， 比如从贝宁寄钱到尼日利亚。 而在委内瑞拉， 因为货币兑换受到控制， 如果你寄了100块钱， 你的家人在另一边如果 能拿到10块钱就不错了。 当然了，没人通过正式渠道往 委内瑞拉寄钱。 都是装在行李箱里带。 收费高的地方， 钱都从地下走了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:44	<br><br>
	
更糟的是， 很多发展中国家实际上 还全面禁止往国外寄钱。 很多富裕国也全面禁止 向某些国家寄钱。 那是不是没有办法， 更好，更便宜的办法寄钱了呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:05	<br><br>
	
还是有的。 通过肯尼亚的M-Pesa寄钱， 手续费是固定的每笔 60美分。 美国联邦政府和墨西哥之间 启动了一个项目， 使得汇款公司往墨西哥寄钱时 只需要每笔67美分的手续费。 但是这些更快，更便宜，更好的办法， 还不能在国际上通用， 因为担心被人利用来洗钱。 虽然没有什么数据 证明这两者之间有什么联系， 就是说洗钱和小额的移民汇款之间 有什么联系。 很多跨国银行 现在害怕拥有汇款公司的账户， 特别是那些业务涉及到 索马里的公司。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:58	<br><br>
	
索马里人均年收入 才250美元。 按月寄往索马里的移民汇款 平均都大于这个数。 移民汇款成了索马里的血脉。 索马里的情况就是个典型的例子， 一方面右手给予很多援助， 另一方面左手又通过各种条规 切断它的经济血脉。 像我这样来自乡村的穷人 还会遇到另一个问题。 在乡村里，唯一能收到汇款的地方 是邮局。 世界上多数国家的政府 都允许邮局和某个汇款公司之间 建立唯一的合作关系。 所以如果我要寄钱给乡下的父亲， 我就必须得去 特定的那一家汇款公司寄。 即使它收费较高， 我也没有其它的选择。 这种情况必须要改变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:04	<br><br>
	
那么，国际组织和社会企业家们 可以做些什么来降低 寄钱回家的费用呢？ 首先，放宽关于一千美元以下的 小额移民汇款的法规， 政府应该意识到， 小额汇款不是洗钱。 第二，政府应该禁止邮局和某个汇款公司 建立唯一的合作关系。 最好是禁止邮局 和任何全国性的银行系统之间 建立这种关系， 实际上，他们应该鼓励竞争， 开放合作伙伴， 这样就可以降低费用， 就像电话业那样。 你们都知道电话业的情况了。 第三，大型非营利性组织 应该在非营利的基础上创建 一个移民汇款平台。 他们应该创建一个非营利的 移民汇款平台来服务于汇款公司， 使他们能降低寄钱的费用， 同时还能不违反世界各地 各种复杂的条规。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:15	<br><br>
	
发展中的社区应该朝着 将移民汇款费率从现在的8%降到1% 的目标努力。 如果我们能把费用降到1%， 将每年省下300亿美元。 比每年给非洲的全部 双边资助预算还多， 而且也比美国政府的全部援助预算 还多，或着几乎相当。 这可是全球最大的捐助国。 实际上，省下的还不止 那三百亿，因为移民汇款渠道 还可以用于救援，贸易和投资。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
另一个严重阻碍移民汇款 到达家人手中的因素， 是高额的非法招工费。 这些费是移民工人 付给给他们找到工作的人的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:11	<br><br>
	
几年前我去过迪拜 我去了一个劳工的营地。 那是晚上8点，又黑又湿又热， 工人们刚刚结束了 一天又苦又累的工作回来。 我和一个孟加拉来的 建筑工人聊了起来。 他一心就想着寄钱回家， 已经寄了几个月了， 可是钱基本上都给了 劳务介绍人， 那个给他找到这份工作的人。 我可以想象得到， 他的妻子 每月盼着这笔钱。 钱汇到了， 她取了钱，转手就得 交给招工的人， 而孩子们只能眼巴巴的看着。 不能再这样下去了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:04	<br><br>
	
这不仅仅发生在孟加拉的建筑工人身上， 而是发生在所有工人身上， 发生在成百上千万的移民工身上。 孟加拉的建筑工 平均每人要付四千美元的找工费， 而这份工作每年只挣两千美元。 也就是说，有两到三年的时间， 他寄回去的钱 都只是在付招工费， 他的家人什么都拿不到。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:36	<br><br>
	
也不仅仅发生在迪拜， 而是发生在全世界 每个大城市的阴暗角落里。 不光是孟加拉的建筑工人 而是全世界的工人们。 也不仅仅发生在男工身上， 女工更经常成为 非法招工的受害者。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
在移民汇款领域， 最新，最令人兴奋的事 是创造移民们存钱和捐钱的新方式。 移民们不仅寄钱回家， 他们自己也存很多钱。 事实上，移民存款据估计每年 达五千亿美元。 大部分的钱都存在银行里， 挣不到半点利息。 如果哪个国家能为移民提供 百分之三到四的利息， 而且说把这些钱用来 在他们出生的国家 修建学校，公路，机场，铁路， 很多移民会拿钱出来的。 因为对他们来说 不仅得到经济利益， 而且也使他们有机会 参与他们自己国家的发展。 可以通过移民汇款的渠道， 把这些债券卖给移民， 因为他们 每个月来寄钱的时候， 就正好是可以向他们出售债券的时候。 也可以用同样的方法 来刺激移民们捐钱。 我会非常希望可以为 在印度修建高速铁路系统投资。 我也会非常愿意为 在我们村防治疟疾投资。 利用移民汇款可以实现 目的性的资源交流， 使最需要的人收益。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
移民汇款是一项强大的资源。 我们应该竭尽全力使 移民汇款和海外招工 更安全，更便宜。 这是能实现的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:45	<br><br>
	
就我而言， 我已经离开印度二十多年了。 我妻子是委内瑞拉人， 孩子们是美国人。 我越来越觉得自己是个全球公民。 但是，我也越来越思念 我出生的地方。 我既想在印度，又想在美国。 我的父母已不在了。 我的兄弟姐妹们也搬走了。 我已经不迫切需要往家寄钱了。 但是时不时地， 我会寄钱回去给朋友， 给亲戚，给村里， 就像我还在那里。 它是我的一部分。 同时，我还在努力成为一名诗人， 为那些辛勤劳作的移民们， 以及他们为摆脱贫困所做的挣扎。 谢谢。 （掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">New thoughts on capital in the twenty-first century</a> </b><br>

French economist Thomas Piketty caused a sensation in early 2014 with his book on a simple, brutal formula explaining economic inequality: r > g (meaning that return on capital is generally higher than economic growth). Here, he talks through the massive data set that led him to conclude: Economic inequality is not new, but it is getting worse, with radical possible impacts. 	<br><br>

It's very nice to be here tonight. 	<br><br>

So I've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past 15 years, and one of the interesting lessons coming from this historical evidence is indeed that, in the long run, there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital to exceed the economy's growth rate, and this tends to lead to high concentration of wealth. Not infinite concentration of wealth, but the higher the gap between r and g, the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:48	<br><br>
	
So this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today, but let me say right away that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income and wealth distribution, and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long-run dynamics of income and wealth distribution. Also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected. We know a little bit more today than we used to know, but we still know too little, and certainly there are many different processes ― economic, social, political ― that need to be studied more. And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force, but that doesn't mean that other important forces do not exist. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:27	<br><br>
	
So most of the data I'm going to present comes from this database that's available online: the World Top Incomes Database. So this is the largest existing historical database on inequality, and this comes from the effort of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries. So let me show you a couple of facts coming from this database, and then we'll return to r bigger than g. So fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the United States and Europe over the past century. So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually much higher in Europe than in the United States, whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States. So let me be very clear: The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g. It has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill, the race between education and technology, globalization, probably more unequal access to skills in the U.S., where you have very good, very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good, so very unequal access to skills, and also an unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the United States, which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education. So there is more going on here, but I'm not going to talk too much about this today, because I want to focus on wealth inequality. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
So let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part. So this is the share of total income going to the top 10 percent. So you can see that one century ago, it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S., so there was more inequality in Europe. Then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the 20th century, and in the recent decade, you can see that the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe, and this is the first fact I just talked about. Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality, and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality, and also that wealth inequality, although it has also increased in recent decades, is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago, although the total quantity of wealth relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by World War I, the Great Depression, World War II. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:49	<br><br>
	
So let me show you two graphs illustrating fact number two and fact number three. So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality, this is the share of total wealth going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders, so you can see the same kind of reversal between the U.S. and Europe that we had before for income inequality. So wealth concentration was higher in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago, and now it is the opposite. But you can also show two things: First, the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality. So remember, for income inequality, the share going to the top 10 percent was between 30 and 50 percent of total income, whereas for wealth, the share is always between 60 and 90 percent. Okay, so that's fact number one, and that's very important for what follows. Wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:47	<br><br>
	
Fact number two is that the rise in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to 1910. So the big difference today, wealth inequality is still very large, with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10, but the good news is that it's actually better than one century ago, where you had 90 percent in Europe going to the top 10. So today what you have is what I call the middle 40 percent, the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50, and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth, national wealth, whereas they used to be poor, a century ago, when there was basically no wealth middle class. So this is an important change, and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels, although the total quantity of wealth has recovered. Okay? So this is the total value of wealth relative to income, and you can see that in particular in Europe, we are almost back to the pre-World War I level. So there are really two different parts of the story here. One has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate, and there is nothing bad per se, of course, in accumulating a lot of wealth, and in particular if it is more diffuse and less concentrated. So what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality, and what's going to happen in the future. How can we account for the fact that until World War I, wealth inequality was so high and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels, and how can we think about the future? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:31	<br><br>
	
So let me come to some of the explanations and speculations about the future. Let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic, dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons. If people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons, you know, to be able to consume when they are old, then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality. But it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model, so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons. So typically, they want to transmit wealth to the next generation, to their children, or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth because of the prestige, the power that goes with wealth. So there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data. Now, in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth, you will have all sorts of random, multiplicative shocks. So for instance, some families have a very large number of children, so the wealth will be divided. Some families have fewer children. You also have shocks to rates of return. Some families make huge capital gains. Some made bad investments. So you will always have some mobility in the wealth process. Some people will move up, some people will move down. The important point is that, in any such model, for a given variance of such shocks, the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising function of r minus g. And intuitively, the reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g. So take a simple example, with r equals five percent and g equals one percent, wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy. So this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths, assuming zero tax, and you can just reinvest one fifth. So of course some families will consume more than that, some will consume less, so there will be some mobility in the distribution, but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth, so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:11	<br><br>
	
Now, you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever, because, in fact, this is what happened during most of the history of mankind. And this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason, which is that growth was close to zero percent during most of the history of mankind. Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent, but very slow growth of population and output per capita, whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent. It was, for land assets, which was the traditional form of assets in preindustrial societies, it was typically five percent. Any reader of Jane Austen would know that. If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds, you should have a capital value of 20,000 pounds so that five percent of 20,000 is 1,000. And in a way, this was the very foundation of society, because r bigger than g was what allowed holders of wealth and assets to live off their capital income and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survival. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
Now, one important conclusion of my historical research is that modern industrial growth did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected. Of course, the growth rate following the Industrial Revolution rose, typically from zero to one to two percent, but at the same time, the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two did not really change. So during the 20th century, you had a very unique combination of events. First, a very low rate of return due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks, destruction of wealth, inflation, bankruptcy during the Great Depression, and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels between 1914 and 1945. And then, in the postwar period, you had unusually high growth rate, partly due to the reconstruction. You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan, you had five percent growth rate between 1950 and 1980 largely due to reconstruction, and also due to very large demographic growth, the Baby Boom Cohort effect. Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long, or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future, and the best projections we have is that the long-run growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent. So if you look at this, these are the best estimates we have of world GDP growth and rate of return on capital, average rates of return on capital, so you can see that during most of the history of mankind, the growth rate was very small, much lower than the rate of return, and then during the 20th century, it is really the population growth, very high in the postwar period, and the reconstruction process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return. Here I use the United Nations population projections, so of course they are uncertain. It could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future, and the growth rates are going to be higher, but from now on, these are the best projections we have, and this will make global growth decline and the gap between the rate of return go up. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:37	<br><br>
	
Now, the other unusual event during the 20th century was, as I said, destruction, taxation of capital, so this is the pre-tax rate of return. This is the after-tax rate of return, and after destruction, and this is what brought the average rate of return after tax, after destruction, below the growth rate during a long time period. But without the destruction, without the taxation, this would not have happened. So let me say that the balance between returns on capital and growth depends on many different factors that are very difficult to predict: technology and the development of capital-intensive techniques. So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector, housing, the energy sector, but it could be in the future that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today. Well, we are very far from this, and from now, what's going on in the real estate sector, the energy sector, is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:44	<br><br>
	
The other important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management, together with financial complexity, financial deregulation, that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large portfolio, and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires, large capital endowments. Just to give you one example, this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings over the 1987-2013 period, and you can see the very top wealth holders have been going up at six, seven percent per year in real terms above inflation, whereas average income in the world, average wealth in the world, have increased at only two percent per year. And you find the same for large university endowments ― the bigger the initial endowments, the bigger the rate of return. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:33	<br><br>
	
Now, what could be done? The first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency. We know too little about global wealth dynamics, so we need international transmission of bank information. We need a global registry of financial assets, more coordination on wealth taxation, and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies to whatever we observe. And to some extent, the fight against tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction. Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth, which it can be tempting to use. Inflation: it's much easier to print money than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting, but sometimes you don't know what you do with the money. This is a problem. Expropriation is very tempting. Just when you feel some people get too wealthy, you just expropriate them. But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics. So war is an even less efficient way, so I tend to prefer progressive taxation, but of course, history ― (Laughter) ― history will invent its own best ways, and it will probably involve a combination of all of these. 	<br><br>

Thank you. 	<br><br>

Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:54	<br><br>
	
Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions, because it's impressive how you're in command of your data, of course, but basically what you suggest is growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism, and if we leave it to its own devices, it may threaten the system itself, so you're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth, including the ones we just saw: progressive taxation, etc. In the current political context, how realistic are those? How likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:29	<br><br>
	
Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think if you look back through time, the history of income, wealth and taxation is full of surprise. So I am not terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen. I think one century ago, many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened. And even five years ago, many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in Switzerland, that Switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world, and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions against Swiss banks for a big change to happen, and now we are moving toward more financial transparency. So I think it's not that difficult to better coordinate politically. We are going to have a treaty with half of the world GDP around the table with the U.S. and the European Union, so if half of the world GDP is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits, what does it take? So I think these are not technical difficulties. I think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:45	<br><br>
	
BG: One of the arguments against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines. So we take measures to lower inequality, and at the same time we lower growth, potentially. What do you answer to that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:00	<br><br>
	
TP: Yeah, I think inequality is not a problem per se. I think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth. The problem is, it's a question of degree. When inequality gets too extreme, then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility. And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the 19th century and pretty much until World War I in every European country was, I think, not useful for growth. This was destroyed by a combination of tragic events and policy changes, and this did not prevent growth from happening. And also, extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice, and the influence of private money in U.S. politics, I think, is a matter of concern right now. So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme, pre-World War I inequality. Having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth. It is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:13	<br><br>
	
BG: I said at the beginning that your book has been criticized. Some of your data has been criticized. Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized. You have been accused of cherry-picking data to make your case. What do you answer to that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:25	<br><br>
	
TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy that this book is stimulating debate. This is part of what it is intended for. Look, the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have an open and transparent debate about this. So I have responded point by point to every concern. Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today, I would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality, particularly in the United States, has been actually higher than what I report in my book. There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman showing, with new data which I didn't have at the time of the book, that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen even more than what I report. And there will be other data in the future. Some of it will go in different directions. Look, we put online almost every week new, updated series on the World Top Income Database and we will keep doing so in the future, in particular in emerging countries, and I welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process. In fact, I certainly agree that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics, and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever we observe. So taxation is a source of knowledge, and that's what we need the most right now. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">A neural portrait of the human mind</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Brain imaging pioneer Nancy Kanwisher, who uses fMRI scans to see activity in brain regions (often her own), shares what she and her colleagues have learned: The brain is made up of both highly specialized components and general-purpose "machinery." Another surprise: There's so much left to learn.	<br><br>

Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind. And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single, general-purpose processor, but a collection of highly specialized components, each solving a different specific problem, and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers. To give you a feel for this idea, 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:42	<br><br>
	
imagine the following scenario: You walk into your child's day care center. As usual, there's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up, but this time, the children's faces look weirdly similar, and you can't figure out which child is yours. Do you need new glasses? Are you losing your mind? You run through a quick mental checklist. No, you seem to be thinking clearly, and your vision is perfectly sharp. And everything looks normal except the children's faces. You can see the faces, but they don't look distinctive, and none of them looks familiar, and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people. It's called prosopagnosia, and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain. The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired; everything else is just fine. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage. These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components, but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology, especially MRI. So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution, so I'm going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross-sectional images through a familiar object, and we're going to fly through them and you're going to try to figure out what the object is. Here we go. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:23	<br><br>
	
It's not that easy. It's an artichoke. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:25	<br><br>
	
Okay, let's try another one, starting from the bottom and going through the top. Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli. Isn't it beautiful? I love that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:34	<br><br>
	
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course. In fact, it's my brain. We're going through slices through my head like that. That's my nose over on the right, and now we're going over here, right there. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:45	<br><br>
	
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself, but it shows only anatomy. The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity, that is, where neurons are firing. So here's how this works. Brains are like muscles. When they get active, they need increased blood flow to supply that activity, and lucky for us, blood flow control to the brain is local, so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there get active and start firing, then blood flow increases just right there. So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase, producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:28	<br><br>
	
So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can't, let me describe one of the first studies I ever did. We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces, and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that I described a moment ago, but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person, so we set out to look for it. So I was the first subject. I went into the scanner, I lay on my back, I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours. So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner, I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:28	<br><br>
	
When I got out of the scanner, I did a quick analysis of the data, looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects, and here's what I saw. Now this image looks just awful by today's standards, but at the time I thought it was beautiful. What it shows is that region right there, that little blob, it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there. And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response, that is, higher neural activity, when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. So that's pretty cool, but how do we know this isn't a fluke? Well, the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. So I got back in the scanner, I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob, and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again, and around about then I decided to believe it was for real. But still, maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there, so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
So the next question was, what does this thing really do? Is it really specialized just for face recognition? Well, maybe not, right? Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part. Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round. The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses. So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images, and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind, and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn't a face, like some of these. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:34	<br><br>
	
So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition? No, we haven't. Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything. All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts. To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function, you need to mess with it and see what happens, and normally we don't get to do that. But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures. So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area. So with the patient's consent, the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain. Now, the patient doesn't know where those electrodes are, and he's never heard of the face area. So let's watch what happens. It's going to start with a control condition that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly in red in the lower left, when no current is delivered, and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:52	<br><br>
	
(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face and tell me what happens when I do this. All right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:59	<br><br>
	
Patient: Okay. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:01	<br><br>
	
Neurologist: One, two, three. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:06	<br><br>
	
Patient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay. I'm going to do it one more time. Look at my face. One, two, three. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
Patient: You just turned into somebody else. Your face metamorphosed. Your nose got saggy, it went to the left. You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before, but somebody different. That was a trip. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:38	<br><br>
	
Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment ― (Applause) ― this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception. So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process. Next, I'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found. So to do this, I've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain. 	<br><br>

So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere. So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way. Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that. Okay, now as you can see, the surface of the brain is all folded up. So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there. We want to see the whole thing, so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing. Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about that responds to images like these. To see that, let's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom, and there it is, that's my face area. Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information, and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places, like right now, I'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active. There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well. Also in this vicinity is a region that's selectively involved in processing visual motion, like these moving dots here, and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain, and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these, and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:31	<br><br>
	
Now all these regions I've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception. Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses, like hearing? Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit, here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago, and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch, like these. (Sirens) (Cello music) (Doorbell) In contrast, that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch, like these. (Chomping) (Drum roll) (Toilet flushing) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
Okay. Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:25	<br><br>
	
Okay, now let's look at these same regions. In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement ― not identical, but similar ― and most of the same regions are in here, albeit sometimes different in size. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:35	<br><br>
	
Now, everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception, vision and hearing. Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy, complicated mental processes? Yes, we do. So here in pink are my language regions. So it's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language, but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively. They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence, but not when you do other complex mental things, like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:20	<br><br>
	
The most amazing region that's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise. This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking. So that may seem crazy, but actually, we humans do this all the time. You're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don't call home to say you're running late. I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain, and what's up with that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:57	<br><br>
	
Well, I'm wondering about that too, and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions. But importantly, I don't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function, even mental functions that may be critical for survival. In fact, a few years ago, there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food, and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this. And further, he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects. So he was pretty stoked, and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah" with his big discovery. But then he devised the critical test: He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape, but that weren't food, like these. And his region responded the same to both sets of images. So it wasn't a food area, it was just a region that liked colors and shapes. So much for "Oprah." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
But then the question, of course, is, how do we process all this other stuff that we don't have specialized brain regions for? Well, I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing, we also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along. In fact, we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all ― well, of the seven that we've tested. So each of the brain regions that I've described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject. I could take any of you, pop you in the scanner, and find each of those regions in your brain, and it would look a lot like my brain, although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:04	<br><br>
	
What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions, but the simple fact that we have selective, specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean, it could have been otherwise. The brain could have been a single, general-purpose processor, more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife. Instead, what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind. So we have this picture of very general-purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:42	<br><br>
	
It's early days in this enterprise. We've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind. The most fundamental questions remain unanswered. So for example, what does each of these regions do exactly? Why do we need three face areas and three place areas, and what's the division of labor between them? Second, how are all these things connected in the brain? With diffusion imaging, you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain, and with this method shown here, you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain, potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain. Third, how does all of this very systematic structure get built, both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species? To address questions like that, scientists are now scanning other species of animals, and they're also scanning human infants. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:47	<br><br>
	
Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism. That's a hugely important goal, and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it, but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing. The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease. What could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience, to understand, in essence, who we are? This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest of all time. 	<br><br>

今天我想告诉大家一个 由全世界各地科学家一起完成的项目。 这个项目希望用神经系统图景 来描绘人类思想。 这一项目的中心论点， 就是人类的思想和大脑 不是一个独立、普通的处理器， 而是一个许多高度专业化的组分的集合。 其中的每一个组分都专门处理不同的问题， 最终这些组分合在一起， 成就了我们人类，思考者们。 为了让你们更好地感受这一理论， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:42	<br><br>
	
请想象一下接下来的场景： 你走进了你孩子的托管中心。 像往常一样，那里有许多的孩子 等待着被家长接走。 但是在这时， 这些孩子们的脸庞看起来奇怪地相似， 你无法分辨出哪一个才是你的孩子。 你是需要一副新眼镜吗？ 你是精神错乱了吗？ 你的脑海中快速地过了一遍自己的精神状况清单 不，你看起来脑子很清楚， 你的视力也十分锐利。 所有事都看起来非常正常， 除了那些孩子们的脸。 你看着这些脸庞， 可它们竟没什么差别， 而且没有一张看起来熟悉。 你只是因为发现了一只橘色发带， 才得以找到你的女儿。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
这种对于认脸能力的突然缺失， 经常在人们身上发生。 这种现象叫做面容失认症， 它是由脑部一个特定部分损伤 而引起的。 这种现象最显著的特征就是， 只有认脸的能力被损害了， 其他的一切都看起来很正常。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
面容失认证是许多很特别的 脑部损伤产生的精神缺陷的其中一种。 这些症状一起 在很早之前就显示出 人的头脑是被均分成了不同的组分的。 但是研究这些组分的努力， 却因为大脑成像技术， 特别是MRI技术的发明 而快速发展，进展迅猛。 所以MRI让你能够很清晰地 看到内在的结构。 我接下来会给你们看看 一系列常见物体的 MRI跨区域影像。 我们将快速地翻动图片， 让你们试着猜猜那些是什么物体。 接下来开始了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:23	<br><br>
	
这个不太容易。这是一朵菊芋。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:25	<br><br>
	
试试另外一个。 从底部开始向顶部移动。 花椰菜！这一一朵花椰菜的顶部。 它很漂亮，不是吗？我很喜欢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:34	<br><br>
	
这里还有一个。当然，这是大脑。 实际上，这是我的大脑。 我们在一部分一部分看透我的大脑。 刚才右边的是我的鼻子， 现在我们已经到了这里，就是这里。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:45	<br><br>
	
要我说，这张照片挺好， 可是它只展示了内部构造。 功能性影像最酷的进步在于 科学家找到制作出 不仅展示构造，更展示内部活动的图片。 也就是神经元的活动。 那么接下来是这项技术的原理。 大脑就像肌肉， 当大脑变得活跃时， 他们需要更多的血液来支撑这样的活动。 正好，控制大脑的血液就存在与大脑中。 所以比如说这儿的一些神经元 变得活跃，开始传输信号， 接下来这儿的血液流量就会增加。 所以功能性MRI专门探测血流量的增加， 当神经活动增强时， 就产生更高的MRI回应。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:28	<br><br>
	
为了让你们更直观的感受 功能性MRI实验如何运作， 还有你们能从中学到什么，学不到什么， 让我给你们讲一讲我做过的第一个研究。 我们想要弄清楚大脑中到底有没有 一个特定的部分帮助人们分辨脸庞。 基于我先前提到的面容失认症的现象， 我们有理由相信， 大脑中这样的部位确实存在。 但是没有人在常人的大脑中 看见过这个部位。 所以我们开始寻找那个部位。 我是第一个实验对象。 我走进扫描仪，平躺下。 我尽量让我的头保持静止 看着像这些照片上的脸庞， 和像这些照片上的物体。 人脸，物体，重复了几个小时。 作为一个已经接近 在MRI扫描仪内待的时间的世界纪录的人 我能告诉你，MRI研究中其中一个 重要的技巧就是 憋尿的本领。 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:28	<br><br>
	
我走出扫描仪后， 我快速分析了那些数据， 寻找有没有任何大脑的部分 在我看人脸时产生了比我看物体时 更高的反应。 这是我看到的数据。 这些图像以今天的标准来看很糟， 但在当时我看来，它很漂亮。 它展示了这里的一块区域， 这里的一小团。 大概和一颗橄榄差不多大。 这部分在我大脑的底层， 大概从这里向里一英寸。 当我看到人脸的时候 我的大脑的这一部分 比我看到物体的时候 产生了更高的MRI反应， 也就是更高的神经活动。 这个结果令人振奋， 但我们怎么能知道这是不是偶然呢？ 当然，最简单的方法， 就是重复做这个实验。 所以我回到了扫描仪里。 我盯着更多的人脸和更多的物体， 也得到了相似的结果。 我又重复， 又重复 重复再重复。 直到那时， 我才决定相信，实验结果是正确的。 但是，仍然有可是事我的大脑有些不同寻常。 有可能其他人都没有我那种问题。 为了证实实验结果，我们又扫描了其他很多人的大脑。 最后发现几乎每个人的大脑里， 在相似的位置上， 都有那一小块识别人脸的区域。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
那么下一个问题来了， 这个区域到底做些什么？ 它是专门只用来识别人脸吗？ 或许有可能不是这样的。 也许它不仅仅对人脸有反应， 也会对任何的人体部位有反应。 也许它会对任何与人类相关的 或者任何生物 或者任何圆形的东西起反应。 为了确定那块小区域 是专门用来识别人脸的， 必须排除掉刚才提到的所有假设。 所以我们花了接下来的好几年， 在实验对象看着许多不同种类图像时 扫描他们的大脑。 我们证明了大脑的那一区域 在你看着任何种类的脸的任何图像时 会起强烈的反应。 当你看的是非脸庞的图像时， 那块区域的反应会弱很多 就像这些图像。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:34	<br><br>
	
那么我们是不是已经确定 脸庞识别必须依靠这一区域了呢？ 不，我们没有。 大脑图像永远不能告诉你 任何东西是否依靠一块区域。 大脑图像能让你做的 只有看着当人们想着不同东西时， 他们大脑各个区域变得活跃或不活跃。 为了确定大脑的一部分是否对于精神功能至关重要， 你需要干扰那一部分的功能，看看会发生什么。 一般我们无法那样做。 但是，一个绝好的机会出现了。 最近我的一些同事 测试了这个在病床上躺着的 患有癫痫的男人。 在他大脑的表层 刚刚被装上了电极， 来弄清他癫痫发作的来源。 结果是非常碰巧地， 其中两个电极 正好在他面部区域的顶端。 所以经过了患者的同意， 医生问他，当电极刺激大脑那个区域时， 发生了什么。 那时，患者还不知道 那些电极在哪儿， 他也从未听说过面部区域。 让我们来看看发生了什么。 一开始，会有一个控制条件。 当没有电流被输送时 左下角会出现一个几乎看不见的 红色字“假装的”。 你会听到神经学家对患者讲话。我们来看看吧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:52	<br><br>
	
（视频）神经学家：好的，看着我的脸。 当我这样做的时候告诉我发生了些什么。 好吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:59	<br><br>
	
患者：好的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:01	<br><br>
	
神经学家：一，二，三。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:06	<br><br>
	
患者：什么也没有发生 神经学家：什么也没有？好的，我会再做一次。 看着我的脸。 一，二，三。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
患者：你变成了另外一个人。 你的脸变形了。 你的鼻子变得松弛，偏向了左边。 你看起来就像一个我以前见过的人， 但其实又不是。 那是幻觉 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:38	<br><br>
	
Nancy Kanwisher：那么这个实验― （掌声）― 这个实验最终证实 大脑这块区域 不仅仅有选择性地对脸庞起反应， 还因此牵涉到脸的感知。 我快速过了一遍有关 面部识别区域的细节来向你们展示 是什么真正证实大脑的一部分 有选择地参与了特别的心理过程。 接下来我会讲得更快一些。 我会讲我们和其他人发现的 其他有专门功能的大脑区域。 过去的一个月里，为了做这件事 我已经在扫描仪里呆了很长时间， 来给你们看看我大脑里的这些东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:17	<br><br>
	
我们开始吧。这是我的右半脑。 我们的方向是这样的。你们在从这个方向看我的大脑。 想象一下把头骨拿走， 像那样看着大脑的皮层。 那么，现在如你所见， 大脑的皮层都是有褶皱的。 这可不太好，可能有东西会藏在里面。 我们想看看到完整的图像。 那我们就展开它来看到完整的东西吧。 接下来，我们来找一找一直都在说的那个 对像这些图像有反应的区域吧。 为了能看见它，我们把大脑转一圈， 从底部看大脑的内部表层， 就是这了，这就是我的脸庞识别区域。 在它的右边是另一个 标示成紫色的区域。 当你在处理颜色信息时它会有反应。 在这些区域的附近还有其他 参与感知地点的区域。 就像现在，我正在看着我周围的布局， 在那这些绿色的区域 非常的活跃。 还有一个区域在外部的大脑皮层， 这儿也还有几个脸庞识别区域。 在这附近 有一个区域，专门参与 处理可视的物体移动 像这些移动的小点。 就是这个在大脑底部的黄色部分。 在那附近有一个区域， 它在你看着身体或身体的部分时会有反应 就是这些在大脑底部 标注成酸橙绿色的区域。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:31	<br><br>
	
目前为止我给你们展示的区域 都参与了特定视觉感知的处理。 那么我们是否有大脑区域， 专门处理其他感官，比如听感呢？ 是的，我们有。如果我们稍微转转大脑。 这有一个深蓝色区域。 我们几个月前才报告了它的存在。 当你听到像这样的有音高的声音时， 这个区域会强烈反应。 (警报) （大提琴声） （门铃） 相比之下，当你听到一些 像这些没有音高的熟悉的声音时， 这个区域反应不会那么强烈。 （咀嚼声） （鼓声） （马桶水声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
好的。在这个区域旁边 是另一堆专门对 说话声起反应的区域。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:25	<br><br>
	
现在我们来看一看这些一样的区域。 在我的左半脑，有相似的排列―― 不是完全一样，但是很相似―― 大多数区域，尽管有时大小不同， 都排列在这里。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:35	<br><br>
	
目前为止我给你们展示的东西 都是参与了不同感官，视觉和听觉， 处理的区域。 那我们还有没有专门处理 很复杂的心理活动的区域呢？ 是的，我们有。 这个粉色区域是我的语言区。 很早，人们就知道 大脑中的这一片区域 参与了语言的处理， 但是我们最近才证实 这些粉色区域 极有选择性地起反应。 它们在你理解一句话的意思时起反应， 却不在你做其他复杂心理活动起反应， 比如说心算， 或者试着记住一条信息， 或者在欣赏一段音乐的 复杂结构。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:20	<br><br>
	
迄今为止发现的最神奇的区域 是这一片青绿色的部分。 这片区域在你思考别人在思考什么的时候 会有反应。 这可能看起来很疯狂， 但事实上，我们人类一直都在做这样的事。 当你意识到 如果你不打电话回家 说你会跑步跑很晚，你的同伴会担心时 你的大脑在这样做。 我现在就在用这块区域这样做。 我在想你们在座各位 可能会琢磨 剩下的那块灰色的没标识的区域 到底是起什么作用的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:57	<br><br>
	
我也在琢磨这个问题。 我们现在在实验室里做大量的实验 来试着寻找其他 大脑可能存在的有特殊功能的 高度专门化区域。 但是很重要的一点是，我不认为我们的大脑 对每一个重要的功能 甚至是关乎生存的功能 都有专门处理的区域。 事实上，几年前， 有一位在我实验室的科学家， 非常确信地说 他发现了一块大脑区域 专门用来识别食物。 在扫描仪里当人们看见这些图像时 这块区域会强烈反应。 此外，他还在12个对象的10个中的大脑中 几乎同样的区域 发现了相同的反应。 他兴奋得不得了 在实验室里跑跑跳跳 告诉每一个人他就要带着他的研究成果 上奥普拉的脱口秀了。 但接下来他做了一个修正实验： 他给实验对象展示了像这样的食物图片， 并用了一些在形状和颜色上相似 但不是食物的图片做对比。 结果是那片区域对于两套图片的 反应强度是一样的。 那么那就不是一块识别食物的区域了 只是一块会对颜色和形状产生反应的区域。 不过这也够拿上奥普拉脱口秀的台面了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
但接下来的问题就是 我们怎样用非专门化的大脑区域 来处理其他的信息呢？ 我认为答案就是 在我刚才说到的那些高度专门化部分以外 我们大脑里还有很多非专业化的机件 他们让我们能够处理 任何出现的困难。 事实上，我们最近证实了 这些白色的区域 会在你做任何困难的大脑工作时起反应。 在我们测试的七个中 都是这样的结果。 所以今天我给你们描述的 每一个大脑区域， 在正常的实验对象的大脑上 都在大概相同的位置。 我能挑你们其中的任意一个人， 把你塞进扫描仪， 然后发现你大脑的那些区域 和我大脑的区域非常相似。 尽管可能这两者间 会在准确的位置和大小上有所不同。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:04	<br><br>
	
对我而言这项工作最重要的 不是那些大脑区域的准确位置， 而是我们得出的结论： 我们的大脑和思想从一开始就由 选择性的和精细的各部分组成。 我的意思是，我们的大脑大可不必成为这样。 大脑可以是一个独立的， 功能宽泛的处理器， 看起来更像一把菜刀 而不是瑞士军刀。 但是，大脑成像呈现给我们的 是人类思想的丰富的和有趣的图景。 这样这图片展示了大脑中 既有功能宽泛的机件， 也有令人惊讶的数量的 高度专门化的组分。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:43	<br><br>
	
我们仍在这项研究的初期， 我们只在人类思想的神经学解释上 迈出了第一步。 最基本的问题仍然没有解答。 比如说，每个这些区域究竟是做什么的？ 为什么我们需要三个脸部区域 和三个地点区域？ 它们之间的分工是怎么样的？ 第二，这些东西 和大脑又是怎样联系起来的？ 借助弥散成像， 你能够追踪许多连接到 大脑各个部分的神经元。 通过这里展示的方法， 你就能找到单个神经元和大脑的联系。 这样也许有一天就能给我们 一幅大脑的线路状图象。 第三，这些非常系统的结构 是怎样在幼年的成长 和在物种的进化中 被建立起来的呢？ 为了解答这样的问题， 科学家们现在在扫描 其他种类的动物。 他们也在扫描人类婴孩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:49	<br><br>
	
许多人为神经元科学研究的高成本辩护， 他们指出这项研究也许某天会帮助我们 治疗如阿兹海默症和自闭症这些神经紊乱。 这是极其重要的目标， 如果我的工作能够给予帮助，我将非常激动。 但是修理世上已经坏掉的东西 不是唯一值得去做的事。 为了了解人类心理和大脑而做出的努力 即使无法用于治疗某种疾病 也是有价值的。 还有什么事 能比了解人类体验的基础机制 和本质上了解“我们是谁” 更令人激动的呢？ 我认为，这是有史以来 最伟大的科学探寻 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Where to train the world's doctors? Cuba.</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Big problems need big solutions, sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity. In this talk, journalist Gail Reed profiles one big solution worth noting: Havana’s Latin American Medical School, which trains global physicians to serve the local communities that need them most. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
I want to tell you how 20,000 remarkable young people from over 100 countries ended up in Cuba and are transforming health in their communities. Ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they'd come from ― remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos ― to become doctors for people like themselves, to walk the walk. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:46	<br><br>
	
Havana's Latin American Medical School: It's the largest medical school in the world, graduating 23,000 young doctors since its first class of 2005, with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline. Its mission, to train physicians for the people who need them the most: the over one billion who have never seen a doctor, the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented. Its students defy all norms. They're the school's biggest risk and also its best bet. They're recruited from the poorest, most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need, that they will practice where most doctors don't, in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous, carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets, their home ground. The hope is that they will help transform access to care, the health picture in impoverished areas, and even the way medicine itself is learned and practiced, and that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage, surely a tall order. Two big storms and this notion of "walk the walk" prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998. The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch had ripped through the Caribbean and Central America, leaving 30,000 dead and two and a half million homeless. Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response, but when they got there, they found a bigger disaster: whole communities with no healthcare, doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff, and just too many babies dying before their first birthday. What would happen when these Cuban doctors left? New doctors were needed to make care sustainable, but where would they come from? Where would they train? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:11	<br><br>
	
In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry to become the Latin American Medical School, ELAM. Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students from the countries hardest hit by the storms. As a journalist in Havana, I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive in March 1999, settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes. Over the next few years, governments throughout the Americas requested scholarships for their own students, and the Congressional Black Caucus asked for and received hundreds of scholarships for young people from the USA. Today, among the 23,000 are graduates from 83 countries in the Americas, Africa and Asia, and enrollment has grown to 123 nations. More than half the students are young women. They come from 100 ethnic groups, speak 50 different languages. WHO Director Margaret Chan said, "For once, if you are poor, female, or from an indigenous population, you have a distinct advantage, an ethic that makes this medical school unique." 	<br><br>

Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho on the Atlantic coast of Honduras. There's no running water, no electricity there, and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did skirting the waves of the Atlantic. Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children who started grammar school, the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the Garifuna, 20 percent of the Honduran population. The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away. Luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school. Only 17 made that trip. Only five went on to high school, and only one to university: Luther, to ELAM, among the first crop of Garifuna graduates. Just two Garifuna doctors had preceded them in all of Honduran history. Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:52	<br><br>
	
Big problems need big solutions, sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity, but also solutions that work. ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them, so they learned the hard way, by doing and correcting course as they went. Even the brightest students from these poor communities weren't academically prepared for six years of medical training, so a bridging course was set up in sciences. Then came language: these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guarani, Garifuna, indigenous peoples who learned Spanish as a second language, or Haitians who spoke Creole. So Spanish became part of the pre-pre-med curriculum. Even so, in Cuba, the music, the food, the smells, just about everything was different, so faculty became family, ELAM home. Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical. Embracing diversity became a way of life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
Why have so many countries asked for these scholarships? First, they just don't have enough doctors, and where they do, their distribution is skewed against the poor, because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources. We are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs, and the problem is everywhere. Doctors are concentrated in the cities, where only half the world's people live, and within cities, not in the shantytowns or South L.A. Here in the United States, where we have healthcare reform, we don't have the professionals we need. By 2020, we will be short 45,000 primary care physicians. And we're also part of the problem. The United States is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:07	<br><br>
	
The second reasons students flock to Cuba is the island's own health report card, relying on strong primary care. A commission from The Lancet rates Cuba among the best performing middle-income countries in health. Save the Children ranks Cuba the best country in Latin America to become a mother. Cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States, with fewer disparities, while spending per person one 20th of what we do on health here in the USA. 	<br><br>

Academically, ELAM is tough, but 80 percent of its students graduate. The subjects are familiar ― basic and clinical sciences ― but there are major differences. First, training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods, the kinds of places most of these grads will practice. Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too, but community-based learning starts on day one. Second, students treat the whole patient, mind and body, in the context of their families, their communities and their culture. Third, they learn public health: to assess their patients' drinking water, housing, social and economic conditions. Fourth, they are taught that a good patient interview and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis, saving costly technology for confirmation. And finally, they're taught over and over again the importance of prevention, especially as chronic diseases cripple health systems worldwide. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:02	<br><br>
	
Such an in-service learning also comes with a team approach, as much how to work in teams as how to lead them, with a dose of humility. Upon graduation, these doctors share their knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives, community health workers, to help them become better at what they do, not to replace them, to work with shamans and traditional healers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:32	<br><br>
	
ELAM's graduates: Are they proving this audacious experiment right? Dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they're capable of doing. Take the Garifuna grads. They not only went to work back home, but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital. With an architect's help, residents literally raised it from the ground up. The first patients walked through the doors in December 2007, and since then, the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits. And government is paying attention, upholding the hospital as a model of rural public health for Honduras. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
ELAM's graduates are smart, strong and also dedicated. Haiti, January 2010. The pain. People buried under 30 million tons of rubble. Overwhelming. Three hundred forty Cuban doctors were already on the ground long term. More were on their way. Many more were needed. At ELAM, students worked round the clock to contact 2,000 graduates. As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti, 27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA. They spoke easily to each other in Spanish and listened to their patients in Creole thanks to Haitian medical students flown in from ELAM in Cuba. Many stayed for months, even through the cholera epidemic. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:20	<br><br>
	
Hundreds of Haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces, overcome their own heartbreak, and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for Haiti. Today, with aid of organizations and governments from Norway to Cuba to Brazil, dozens of new health centers have been built, staffed, and in 35 cases, headed by ELAM graduates. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:47	<br><br>
	
Yet the Haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries. Take a look: 748 Haitian graduates by 2012, when cholera struck, nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed, and 110 had left Haiti altogether. So in the best case scenarios, these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems, where often they're the only doctors around. In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector, where most poor people are treated, not enough political will, not enough resources, not enough anything ― just too many patients with no care. The grads face pressure from their families too, desperate to make ends meet, so when there are no public sector jobs, these new MDs decamp into private practice, or go abroad to send money home. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
Worst of all, in some countries, medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the ELAM degree, fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income. It's not a question of competencies. Here in the USA, the California Medical Board accredited the school after rigorous inspection, and the new physicians are making good on Cuba's big bet, passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from New York to Chicago to New Mexico. Two hundred strong, they're coming back to the United States energized, and also dissatisfied. As one grad put it, in Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources, so when I see all the resources we have here, and you tell me that's not possible, I know it's not true. Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:57	<br><br>
	
ELAM's graduates, some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore, have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health, education and a voice to their communities. They've done the heavy lifting. Now we need to do our part to support the 23,000 and counting, All of us ― foundations, residency directors, press, entrepreneurs, policymakers, people ― need to step up. We need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle. They need to be able to take their countries' licensing exams. They need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work. They need the chance to be the doctors their patients need. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:57	<br><br>
	
To move forward, we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family's door on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid, who made house calls, who was a public servant. These aren't such new ideas of what medicine should be. What's new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves: an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she than a he; In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala, an indigenous doctor; in the USA, a doctor of color who speaks fluent Spanish. She is well trained, can be counted on, and shares the face and culture of her patients, and she deserves our support surely, because whether by subway, mule, or canoe, she is teaching us to walk the walk. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:58	<br><br>
	
Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

我想为你们讲述 来自超过100个国家的 20,000个杰出的年轻人， 如何在古巴相聚， 并改变他们所在社区的医疗状况。 他们中， 如果不是因为有去古巴学医的奖学金， 90%的人原来根本不会离开家。 他们这么做也是想今后献身于 他们走出来的地方， 偏远农村、山区，以及贫民窟， 成为医生去帮助那些像他们一样的人， 将梦想 付诸行动 。 	<br><br>

哈瓦那的拉丁美洲医学院， 是世界上最大的医学院。 自2005年第一班毕业生以来， 已培养了23,000名年轻的医生， 另有近10,000名正在就读中。 其使命是， 为那些最需要医生的人们培养医生： 那些超过10亿的 从没见过医生的人们。 这些人从出生到死亡， 一辈子生活在各种贫困线之下。 这些学生不同寻常， 他们既是学校最大的风险所在， 也是学校的一张王牌。 他们来自地球上最贫穷、 最破败的地区， 被一所相信他们可以成为 不仅优秀的， 更是卓越的医生的学校录取， 而卓越的医生正是他们的社区亟需的。 他们将在大多数医生不愿意去的地方行医， 那些地方不仅贫穷， 还时常危险， 他们的背包里要常备解毒药， 或游走于 充满毒品、帮派、炮火的邻里乡间， 这就是他们的家乡。 学校寄予学生的希望是， 使当地人能够获取便捷的医疗服务， 改变贫穷地区的医疗状况， 甚至学医和行医本身的 践行方式。 并且， 他们将成为先锋， 把医疗服务推向世界的各个角落， 这诚然是个艰巨的任务。 两场大风暴和 付诸行动 的理念， 促成了拉丁美洲医学院在1998年的建校。 乔治飓风和米契飓风 肆虐加勒比海和中美洲， 造成了30,000人死亡， 二百五十万人无家可归。 数以百计的古巴医生自愿为灾区服务， 但当他们到达灾区， 他们发现了更大的灾难： 整个社区都没有医疗服务， 乡村医院因缺少医护人员 而门窗紧锁， 太多的孩子 在第一个生日来临前死亡。 这些古巴医生离开后，会是怎样的情境？ 需要有新的医生来持续提供医疗服务， 但他们从哪里来呢？ 他们在哪接受培训呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:11	<br><br>
	
在哈瓦那，一座海军学院的旧校园， 被古巴卫生部接管， 后来变为拉丁美洲医学院， 也就是 ELAM。 学校提供学费、食宿、小额津贴 给那些数以百计的 来自受风暴影响最严重国家的学生。 作为一个在哈瓦那的记者， 我在1999年3月 看到第一批来自尼加拉瓜的97位学生， 入住进刚刚翻修过的宿舍里， 不仅帮助教授们清扫教室， 还帮助他们搬入桌椅、显微镜。 几年后， 美洲的诸多政府 为本国的学生争取奖学金名额， 美国国会黑人同盟 为美国的年轻人 申请并获得了数以百计的奖学金名额。 如今， 这些23,000名已毕业的医生， 分别来自于美洲、非洲、亚洲的83个国家， 而入学学生的生源国已增长到123个国家。 学生中超过半数是年轻女性， 她们来自100个民族， 说着50种不同的语言。 世界卫生组织总干事陈冯富珍说：  一旦你出身贫困、身为女性、 或来自当地族群， 你就拥有了一种独特的优势， 这套办学观念使这座医学院显得独一无二。  	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:42	<br><br>
	
卢瑟 卡斯蒂略来自洪都拉斯大西洋沿岸的 圣佩德罗 图卡玛奇市。 那里没有自来水， 没有电， 你需要步行数小时才能到达那里的村庄， 或像我一样，靠运气搭上一辆卡车， 在大西洋沿岸破浪前行。 卢瑟是来自图卡玛奇市 40个的上过小学的孩子中的一员。 他们是的当地黑人原住民的孩子， 这些黑人被称为加利福纳人， 占洪都拉斯人口数量的20%左右。 最近的医疗服务竟有数英里远。 卢瑟需要每天步行3小时 才能到中学。 那40个人中只有17人上了中学， 只有5人上了高中， 只有1人上了大学： 他就是卢瑟，来到了拉丁美洲医学院， 成为第一批加利福纳人的毕业生。 在洪都拉斯的历史上，这批学生之前， 只产生过两名加利福纳人医生。 仰赖于拉丁美洲医学院的培养，如今已有69名了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
5:53	<br><br>
	
非常问题需要非常手段， 这些非常手段由伟大的理念、想象力和胆识激发， 也由已经见效的各种办法激发。 拉丁美洲医学院的教员们，没有现成的经验 来指导如此庞大的学生，因此他们只能艰苦地摸索， 边做边学边调整。 即便是来自贫穷地区的 最聪明的学生， 也没在学业上做好 接受六年医疗训练的准备， 因此设立了一门衔接性课程。 然后是语言关： 这里有马普切人、克丘亚人、瓜拉尼人、加利福那人， 都是当地的原住民。 他们以西班牙语为第二语言， 或是讲克里奥耳语的海地人。 因此西班牙语 成了一门医学预预科的课程。 即便如此，在古巴， 音乐、食物、气味， 几乎一切都不一样， 因此教职员工就像家人一样，拉丁美洲医学院就是家乡。 宗教信仰有当地的信仰、 约鲁巴信仰、穆斯林信仰，以及基督教福音派信仰。 接受多元化成为了一种生活方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
为何有这么多的国家 申请拉丁美洲医学院的奖学金？ 第一，这些国家没有足够的医生， 即使在那些有足够数量的医生的国家， 医疗资源的分布也不利于穷人就医， 医护人员的人力资源缺乏 造成了全球医疗危机。 要满足基本医疗需求， 至少短缺400至700万的医护工作者， 这种短缺随处可见。 医生集中在城市， 而世界人口只有一半住在城市， 并且医生多在市区， 不在贫民窟或南洛杉矶。 在美国， 这里正在推行医疗改革， 可专业的医护人员仍显不足。 到2020年， 初级护理医师缺口将达45,000人， 我们也有部分责任： 美国是最大的 发展中国家医生输入国。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:07	<br><br>
	
学生们涌向古巴的第二个原因， 是这个岛屿上 依赖强大的基础医疗护理的人们的健康水平。 《柳叶刀》的委员会， 将古巴列为 中等收入国家中健康水平最好的国家之一。 拯救儿童基金会将古巴列为 拉丁美洲最适合做母亲的国家。 古巴居民预期寿命跟美国基本持平， 婴儿死亡率要比美国更低， 不平等的地方更少， 而古巴人均医疗费用 只是 美国的二十分之一。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
拉丁美洲医学院对学业要求很严格， 但毕业率达到80%。 所学科目（跟别处相比）基本一样 ――基础和临床医学―― 但也有很大的不同。 第一，医护培训走出了象牙塔， 学生们可在临床教室和周边社区实践， 大部分毕业生都会在这样的地方锻炼。 当然，他们也会听讲座，也会在医院轮班， 但基于社区的医疗实习从第一天就开始了。 第二，学生全方位的诊疗病人， 结合他们的家庭、社区、 文化背景， 给予他们身体和心理上的照料。 第三，他们学习公共卫生， 评估病人的饮用水、住房、 社会和经济状况。 第四，他们已经懂得， 良好的问诊 和细致的临床检查， 已经能为诊断提供大部分线索， 从而不需要使用昂贵的技术进行确诊。 最后，他们被反复教导 预防的重要性， 尤其是慢性疾病来说更是如此， 慢性疾病已经使世界各地的医疗系统不堪重负。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
这样的服务性学习， 团队合作的方式， 使他们学会了如何以一种谦逊的态度 与别人协作， 以及如何领导团队。 毕业时，这些医生将自己的知识和经验 与护士、助产士、 社区医疗工作者分享， 来帮助他们，而非要替代他们， 让他们的工作更加优秀， 以及与萨满和传统疗法的医护者协作。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:32	<br><br>
	
拉丁美洲医学院的毕业生： 他们的实际行动证明了这项大胆的试验是正确的吗？ 通过数十个项目的成效， 我们可对他们的能力略窥一二。 以加利福纳毕业生为例， 他们不仅回到家乡工作， 还联合当地社区， 创办了洪都拉斯第一家本土医院。 受一位建筑师之助， 毫不夸张的说，人们从无到有地建立了这座医院。 第一批病人 在2007年12月步入医院大门， 从那时起， 医院接待了近100万人次病人求诊。 政府对此也更加关注， 将这所医院树立为 洪都拉斯农村公共医疗的典范。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:19	<br><br>
	
拉丁美洲医学院的毕业生不但聪慧、 坚强，而且极富使命感。 海地，2010年1月， 永远的伤痛。 人们被埋在3000万吨碎石下。 太让人难以接受了。 340名古巴医生已就绪， 开展长期服务， 更多的人在前去的路上，但还需要更多。 在拉丁美洲医学院， 学生们昼夜不停地联系2000名毕业生， 结果，数以百计的毕业生来到海地， 他们从撒哈拉的马里共和国， 到圣卢西亚、玻利维亚、智利和美国等27个国家而来。 他们之间用西班牙语自如的沟通， 由于有古巴拉丁美洲医学院的 海地籍学生加入救援， 他们得以与伤者用克里奥耳语交流。 很多人在此停留了数月， 即使霍乱蔓延的情况下也是如此。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:20	<br><br>
	
数以百计的海地毕业生 不得不收拾残局， 暂搁自己的悲伤， 扛起为海地建立 新的公共医疗系统的重担。 如今， 在挪威、古巴、巴西的政府和各类组织的帮助下， 数十个医疗中心已建立起来，医护人员也配备到位， 其中35个医疗中心， 由拉丁美洲医学院的毕业生主持工作。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:47	<br><br>
	
海地的故事 也表明了其他诸多国家 面临的更大的问题。 看一下吧： 2012年，在霍乱爆发时，748名海地毕业生， 接近一半在公共医疗机构工作， 但有四分之一没有工作， 110名已离开了海地。 因此，在最好的情况下， 这些学生都会有工作， 加强公共医疗系统的服务， 在尚未有医疗服务的地区开展工作。 最糟糕的情况下， 公共医疗机构并没有足够多的工作机会， 而公共医疗机构正是大多数穷人看病的地方， 政治意愿不够强烈，资源匮乏， 一切都是缺乏的， 唯一不缺泛的，就是有太多的病人得不到医疗服务。 毕业生也面临着来自家庭的压力， 他们的家庭绝望的在温饱线上挣扎， 因此，当缺少公共部门的就业机会时， 这些医学博士就进入私人执业， 或出国工作，把钱寄回家。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
最为糟糕的是，在一些国家， 在医疗协会的影响下， 认证机构不承认拉丁美洲医学院的学位， 担心这些毕业生会抢他们的饭碗， 或者会减少病人的数量及他们的收入。 这并非胜任力的问题。 在美国，拉美医学院经过严格考核后， 得到了加州医疗委员会的认证， 这些新医生不负众望， 表现优异， 从纽约到芝加哥，到新墨西哥州， 他们通过了审核，得到肯定， 成为受高度尊敬的新居民。 200位毕业生回到美国， 干劲十足， 但也有不满意的地方。 就像一位毕业生所说的， 在古巴， 我们学习在最有限的资源下 如何提供高质量的医疗护理， 所以当我看到我们在这所拥有的全部资源， 你还告诉我那是不可能的， 我知道这不是事实。 我不只是看到它能实现，我还亲自做成功了。  	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:57	<br><br>
	
拉丁美洲医学院的毕业生， 有些就来自这儿，华盛顿特区和巴尔的摩， 有些来自最贫穷的地方， 来为他们的社区提供医疗服务、教育， 并为社区 代言 。 他们已扛起重担。 现在我们要做的是 支持这23000名及后续的毕业生。 我们所有的人―― 基金会、居委会理事、媒体、 企业家、政策制定者，以及我们大家―― 都需要行动起来。 我们需要在全球范围内 为这些新医生提供更多的机会， 使他们能够施展才华。 他们需要 通过所在国家的执业考试， 他们需要有公共医疗机构 或非营利医疗机构的工作， 来把他们所学和使命付诸实践。 他们需要得到机会， 成为病人所需的医生。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:56	<br><br>
	
为了推进医疗事业， 我们或许不得不 回到一位儿科医生的道路上来。 在我还是个孩子的时候， 他到我们位于南芝加哥的家来拜访。 他上门服务， 他真是一位人民公仆。 这些内容，对于医疗服务来说， 没有什么新颖之处。 新颖的是其覆盖范围的扩大， 以及医生的面庞： 拉丁美洲医学院的毕业生， 更可能是一名女性而非男性； 一位在亚马逊、秘鲁或危地马拉 当地行医的本土医生； 在美国，很可能是一位能说流利的西班牙语的 有色人种医生。 她们受过良好训练，值得信赖， 她们与病人来自同一种族，并有文化共通感， 她们理应获得我们的支持， 因为无论是坐着地铁、骑着骡子，还是乘着独木舟， 她们都在教我们怎样将想法 付诸行动 。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:59	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">The career advice you probably didn’t get</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
You’re doing everything right at work, taking all the right advice, but you’re just not moving up. Why? Susan Colantuono shares a simple, surprising piece of advice you might not have heard before quite so plainly. This talk, while aimed at an audience of women, has universal takeaways ― for men and women, new grads and midcareer workers. 	<br><br>
Susan Colantuono	<br><br>

Women represent 50 percent of middle management and professional positions, but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. So some people hear that statistic and they ask, why do we have so few women leaders? But I look at that statistic and, if you, like me, believe that leadership manifests at every level, you would see that there's a tremendous, awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management, which raises a different question: Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:01	<br><br>
	
So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization. Well, Tonya is a great example of one of these women. I met her two years ago. She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company, and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration, "I've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand, I get terrific performance evals from my boss, my 360s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me, I've taken every management course that I can here, I am working with a terrific mentor, and yet I've been passed over twice for advancement opportunities, even when my manager knows that I'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment. I don't understand why I'm being passed over." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
So what Tonya doesn't realize is that there's a missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women, and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is that's required to close the gender gap at the top. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:21	<br><br>
	
In order to move up in organizations, you have to be known for your leadership skills, and this would apply to any of you, women or men. It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. Put in other language, it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside. And although all three of these elements of leadership are important, when it comes to moving up in organizations, they aren't equally important. So pay attention to the green box as I move forward. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:18	<br><br>
	
In seeking and identifying employees with high potential, the potential to go to the top of organizations, the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership. These skills and competencies can be summarized as business, strategic, and financial acumen. In other words, this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going, what its strategy is, what financial targets it has in place, and understanding your role in moving the organization forward. This is that missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women, not because it's missing in our capabilities or abilities, but because it's missing in the advice that we're given. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
Here's what I mean by that. Five years ago, I was asked to moderate a panel of executives, and the topic for the evening was "What do you look for in high-potential employees?" So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:35	<br><br>
	
They said, "We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient." So which element of leadership does that relate to? Personal greatness. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
They said, "We look for employees who are great with our customers, who empower their teams, who negotiate effectively, who are able to manage conflict well, and are overall great communicators." Which element of leadership does that equate to? Engaging the greatness in others. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:12	<br><br>
	
And then they pretty much stopped. So I asked, "Well, what about people who understand your business, where it's going, and their role in taking it there? And what about people who are able to scan the external environment, identify risks and opportunities, make strategy or make strategic recommendations? And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business, understand the story that the financials tell, and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
And to a man, they said, "That's a given." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:53	<br><br>
	
So I turned to the audience of 150 women and I asked, "How many of you have ever been told that the door-opener for career advancement is your business, strategic and financial acumen, and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool?" Three women raised their hand, and I've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since, and the percentage is never much different. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:26	<br><br>
	
So this is obvious, right? But how can it be? Well, there are primarily three reasons that there's this missing 33 percent in the career success advice given to women? When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over 40 years, there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business, strategic and financial acumen. Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take, like become more assertive, become more confident, develop your personal brand, things that Tonya's been working on, and advice about working with other people, things like learn to self-promote, get a mentor, enhance your network, and virtually nothing said about the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen. This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant. What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management, but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle, where we're 50 percent, to senior and executive positions. And this is why conventional advice to women in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top and won't close it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:53	<br><br>
	
Now, the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals, great feedback from her teams, and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. So you would think that she's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business, strategic and financial acumen, but here again, that green square is quite small. On average, talent and performance management systems in the organizations that I've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen, which is why typical talent and performance systems haven't closed and won't close the gender gap at the top. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:54	<br><br>
	
Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor, and this is really important to talk about, because if organizations, talent and performance systems aren't giving people in general information about the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen, how are men getting to the top? Well, there are primarily two ways. One is because of the positions they're guided into, and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
So what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring? Well, this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. He was very proud of the fact that last year, he had two proteges: a man and a woman. And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence, I helped the man learn the business, and I didn't realize that I was treating them any differently." And he was sincere about that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
So what this illustrates is that as managers, whether we're women or men, we have mindsets about women and men, about careers in leadership, and these unexamined mindsets won't close the gender gap at the top. So how do we take this idea of the missing 33 percent and turn it into action? Well, for women, the answer is obvious: we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses, where they're headed, and our role in taking it there. That's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top. But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this. One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing 33 percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:00	<br><br>
	
So we don't want to put 100 percent of the responsibility on women's shoulders, nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why: In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals, executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction. In other words, the term we use in business is, we have to have strategic alignment. And executives know this very well, and yet only 37 percent, according to a recent Conference Board report, believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. So for 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. And if you think about what I've just shared, that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business, where it's headed, and their role in taking it there, it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low, which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions. Why? Because if they aren't seeing that, it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be. It's important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools, and if they hear comments like, "Well, she doesn't have enough business experience," ask the question, "What are we going to do about that?" It's important for H.R. executives to make sure that the missing 33 percent is appropriately emphasized, and it's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men, about careers and success, to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:07	<br><br>
	
So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonya's story. Tonya emailed me two months ago, and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position, and during the interview, they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry, and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the chief information officer at her company. So for some of you, the missing 33 percent is an idea for you to put into action, and I hope that for all of you, you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective, to help women create careers that soar, and to help close the gender gap at the top. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

女性占据 50%的中层管理 和专业职位， 但在企业高层职务中女人所占的百分比 甚至还不到上述数字的三分之一。 因此一些人听到这个统计数据后就会问， 为什么女性领导者如此之少？ 但是我看着这个统计数据 并且，如果你跟我一样，相信 那上面显示的各级别领导人数， 你会看到中管管理 有着数量惊人的 杰出女性领导者， 由此你会提出另一个问题： 为什么有这么多女性 卡在中层？ 她们怎样 才能升到高层？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:01	<br><br>
	
你们中的一些人可能正是 那些正在寻求升职的 女性中层管理者。 嗯，汤娅是这些女性中一个典型例子。 我两年前认识她。 那时她是一家财富50强企业的副总裁， 她怀着一种深深的挫败感对我说： “我很努力去提升我的自信 和魄力，并且将自己 打造成一个很棒的品牌， 我从上司那里得到了很好的评价， 公司的360度测评让我知道 我的团队很喜欢为我工作， 我参加了公司所有管理课程， 我跟一个很优秀的导师一起工作， 但是我已经错失了 两次升职机会， 尽管我的经理知道 我一直致力于升职 并且愿意接受海外派遣。 我不明白为什么 我会错失晋升的机会。“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
汤娅没有意识到的 是对于女性来说 在事业成功方程式中有一个失踪的33%， 并且要想理解这个失踪的33%是什么。 这就需要减小高层中的性别差异。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:21	<br><br>
	
为了在组织中获得晋升， 你必须要显现你的领导才能， 这也适用于你们中的所有人， 不管是女性还是男性。 这意味着你必须 运用你的长处去获得认可， 并让别人发挥优势 去获得和维持非凡的成果。 换句话说， 它意味着你必须使用你的技巧、 天赋和才能， 帮助企业实现 战略财务目标， 并且通过与企业内外的人 有效地合作，以达到上述目标。 虽然领导能力中的这三个要素 都很重要， 但当涉及到在组织中获得晋升时， 它们的重要性是不一样的。 接下来请注意 绿色柱条。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:18	<br><br>
	
在寻找和确定 拥有高潜能―― 那种能做到企业高层的潜能 ――的员工时， 技巧和能力， 也就是图中的绿色柱条， 它们的重要性 是领导能力中其它两个要素的两倍。 这些技巧和能力 可以总结为商业、 战略和财务智慧。 换句话说，这套技能必须要与 理解企业发展方向、 发展战略、 财务目标相结合， 并且要理解 你在企业发展过程中所扮演的角色。 这就是女性的事业成功方程式中 那迷失的33%， 不是因为我们的才能 不足， 而是因为 没能得到合理的建议。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
接下来我举个例子。 5前年，我应邀主持 一场高管会议， 当晚的主题是 “对于高潜力的员工， 你最看着他们的哪些特点？“ 想一想我根据他们所说 为你们总结出来的三个领导力要素。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:35	<br><br>
	
他们说，“我们寻找那些 聪明、勤奋、坚定、 可靠和抗压力强的员工。“ 这与哪个领导力要素相关呢？ 个人的卓越能力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
他们说，“我们寻找那些 能够与客户融洽相处， 能够增强团队力量， 能够有效谈判， 能够妥善处理冲突的员工， 总的来说就是非常善于沟通的人。“ 这又是哪个领导力要素呢？ 帮助他人发挥优势。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:12	<br><br>
	
这时他们默不作声。 因此我就问， “嗯，那你们怎么看待 那些了解公司业务， 知道公司走向， 并且知道自己在其中 扮演什么角色的人呢？ 你们怎么看待那些能够 审视外部环境， 识别危险和机遇， 制定策略或者提出战略性建议的人呢？ 以及如何看待那些 面对公司财务报表 能理解它所透露出来的讯息， 然后采取适当行动 或者提出适当建议的人呢？“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
对于男性，他们表示， “这些都是理所当然的。“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:53	<br><br>
	
因此我转向现场的 150位女性观众，然后问她们， “你们当中有多少人曾经被告知过 职场晋升的敲门砖 是你的商业、战略和财务智慧， 然后其它的重要能力 都只是将你与人才库中的 其他人区分出来而已？" 只有三位女性举手， 而这五年来这个问题我也 问过全球各地女性， 得到的答复都差不多。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:26	<br><br>
	
这很明显，对吧？ 但是为什么会这样呢？ 嗯，主要有三个原因可以解释 为什么给女性关于成功职业的建议中 有一个失踪的33%。 当企业给女性 提供指导时， 一般都集中在传统的建议， 我们已经听了超过40年的那种建议， 而对于那些跟商业、战略和财务目标 有关的建议则很少提到。 大多数建议都是强调 那些我们需要采取的个人行动， 比如说变得更加坚定、更加自信， 打造自己的个人品牌， 也就是汤娅一直 在努力实现的那些目标， 以及一些关于如何 与其他人共事的建议， 比如说学会自我推销、 找一个导师、增强你的人际网络。 事实上没人说过 商业、策略 和财务智慧的重要性。 但这并不意味着这个建议不重要。 而是意味着这个建议 是从职业生涯开端向中层管理 突破所必需的建议， 但它不是那种 能让女性 从中层管理―― 这个女性占据50%份额的位置―― 向高管职位突破的建议。 这就是为什么这些给女性的传统建议 在这40年间并没有缩小 高层职位上的性别差异， 而且将来也不会缩小。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:53	<br><br>
	
接下来，第二个原因 跟为什么汤娅 在上级那里得到很好的评价、 从团队里得到不错的反馈、 并且参加了所有能参加的管理课程， 却得不到晋升有关。 你可能会认为她 通过人才发展系统 和绩效管理系统 从公司获得了信息， 让她知道发展商业、策略和财务智慧 是多么重要， 但是你看，绿色柱条还是非常小。 平均来说， 在我工作过的那些组织里的 人才和绩效管理系统 对于另外两项领导能力要素 的重视 是商业、 策略和财务智慧的三倍， 这就是为什么传统的 人才和绩效管理系统 过去并没有，而且将来也不会缩小 高层管理中的性别差异。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:54	<br><br>
	
汤娅也谈到过跟导师一起工作， 这个真的很重要， 因为如果组织的 人才和绩效管理系统 没有给大家提供 关于商业、策略和财务智慧 重要性的信息， 那么男性又是如何获得提升的呢？ 主要来说有两种方式。 一个是因为 他们会被引导进入这些职位， 另一个是私下的指导 和支持。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
关于指导， 女性又有怎样的体验呢？ 最近与我共事的 一位主管 向我介绍了他的经验。 他感到很自豪，因为去年 他收了两个徒弟：一男一女。 他说：“我帮这个女徒弟建立自信， 帮这个男徒弟学习业务， 我没有意识到我教他们的东西 有任何不同。“ 他说的是实话。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
所以这说明 作为主管，不管我们是女是男， 我们都对于女性和男性、 对于他们的领导能力有不同的心态， 而这些未经检验的心态 不可能缩小高层管理中的性别差距。 那我们要如何看待 失踪的33% 并采取措施呢？ 对于女性来说，答案很明显： 我们必须开始集中更多精力 发展和展现那些 我们已有的、 能显示出我们是那种理解 企业业务和发展走向 以及自己定位的技能。 这样，我们才能 从中层管理 向高层突破。 我们不用等到中层管理才这样做。 有一个生物技术公司的青年科学家 利用她对失踪的33%的了解 将财务影响数据编进了 她做的一个项目更新报告里， 然后获得了管理层 极大的正面反馈。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:00	<br><br>
	
我们不想将责任 100%的压在女性肩膀上， 这样做也不理智，原因如下： 为了让公司达到 战略性财务目标， 主管们明白他们必须 让所有人向同一个方向使劲。 换句话说，用商业术语来说就是， 我们必须要有战略一致性。 主管们很清楚这一点， 但是根据世界大型企业联合会的最新报告， 只有37%的主管 相信他们拥有 战略一致性。 所以有63%的组织， 对于能不能达到他们的战略财务目标 还存有疑问。 想一下我刚才所说的， 如果你有至少50%的 中层管理 没有收到明确的信息， 不知道他们必须专注于业务和 它的走向以及他们在其中扮演的角色， 那么也就不必惊讶 为什么对于战略一致性 有信心的主管的比例 会如此的低， 这也是为什么他们 需要别人的帮忙。 对于董事会来说 很期待在每年的会议上 看到一定比例的 女性主管。 为什么呢？因为如果不是这样的话， 那可能就是一个危险信号， 说明他们组织的一致性 不如预期理想。 对于首席执行官来说， 这一比例也很重要， 如果他们听到类似于 “她没有足够的商业经验”这样的评论， 那么就要问 “我们要怎样去解决这个问题？” 对于人事主管们来说 确保失踪的33% 被适当地强调很重要， 而对于处在管理职位上的 女性和男性来说 审视我们 对于女性和男性、事业和成功 所持有的不同心态也很重要， 确保我们是在为所有人 创造一个平等的竞争环境。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:07	<br><br>
	
让我用汤娅故事的最新章节 来结束今天的演讲。 2个月前，汤娅给我发了邮件， 她说她当时面试了一个新职位， 面试中，他们考察了 她的商业才智 和她对于行业的战略观点， 她说她很高兴地向我报告 现在她有了一个新职位， 直接向公司首席信息官 报告。 所以对你们中的一些人来说，失踪的33% 是一个让你付诸行动的想法， 并希望对你们所有人都有所帮助， 你会看到它是一个值得传播的想法， 它可以帮助组织提高效率， 帮助女性获得升迁， 以及帮助缩小高层管理中的性别差距。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">“Am I dying?” The honest answer.</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Matthew O’Reilly is a veteran emergency medical technician on Long Island, New York. In this talk, O’Reilly describes what happens next when a gravely hurt patient asks him: “Am I going to die?” 	<br><br>
Matthew O'Reilly	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County, New York. I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:20	<br><br>
	
If you are like most people, death might be one of your greatest fears. Some of us will see it coming. Some of us won't. There is a little-known documented medical term called impending doom. It's almost a symptom. As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other, so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says, "I'm going to die today," we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:44	<br><br>
	
Throughout my career, I have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them. With this, I was faced with a dilemma: Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death, or do I lie to them to comfort them? Early in my career, I faced this dilemma by simply lying. I was afraid. I was afraid if I told them the truth, that they would die in terror, in fear, just grasping for those last moments of life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
That all changed with one incident. Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident. The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries. As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him, and like so many other cases, he looked me in the eye and asked that question: "Am I going to die?" In that moment, I decided to do something different. I decided to tell him the truth. I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him. His reaction shocked me to this day. He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be. He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes, I saw inner peace and acceptance. From that moment forward, I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies. Having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them, in almost every case, they have all had the same reaction to the truth, of inner peace and acceptance. In fact, there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:36	<br><br>
	
The first pattern always kind of shocked me. Regardless of religious belief or cultural background, there's a need for forgiveness. Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret, their guilt is universal. I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack. As I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest, I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise. He already knew by my tone of voice and body language. As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest, prepping for what was going to happen, he looked me in the eye and said, "I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time." Faced with imminent death, all he wanted was forgiveness. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:27	<br><br>
	
The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance. Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones', they needed to feel that they would be living on. There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones, myself, my crew, or anyone around. Countless times, I have had a patient look me in the eyes and say, "Will you remember me?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:53	<br><br>
	
The final pattern I observe always touched me the deepest, to the soul. The dying need to know that their life had meaning. They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:08	<br><br>
	
This came to me very, very early in my career. I had responded to a call. There was a female in her late 50s severely pinned within a vehicle. She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed, critical, critical condition. As the fire department worked to remove her from the car, I climbed in to begin to render care. As we talked, she had said to me, "There was so much more I wanted to do with my life." She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth. As we talked further, it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school. Because of her, two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors. It would end up taking 45 minutes to free her from the vehicle. However, she perished prior to freeing her. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:03	<br><br>
	
I believed what you saw in the movies: when you're in those last moments that it's strictly terror, fear. I have come to realize, regardless of the circumstance, it's generally met with peace and acceptance, that it's the littlest things, the littlest moments, the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Big data is better data</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Self-driving cars were just the start. What's the future of big data-driven technology and design? In a thrilling science talk, Kenneth Cukier looks at what's next for machine learning ― and human knowledge. 	<br><br>
Kenneth Cukier	<br><br>
 Sep 2014 	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
America's favorite pie is? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:15	<br><br>
	
Audience: Apple. Kenneth Cukier: Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it? Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of 30-centimeter pies that are frozen, and apple wins, no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller, 11-centimeter pies, and suddenly, apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why? What happened? Okay, think about it. When you buy a 30-centimeter pie, the whole family has to agree, and apple is everyone's second favorite. (Laughter) But when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie, you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:24	<br><br>
	
Now, the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more, more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case, it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is: not apple. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:49	<br><br>
	
Now, you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact, you're probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term, and that is very unfortunate, because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past, we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world, and now we have a lot more of it, more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data, we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important, and big data is new, and when you think about it, the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges ― to feed people, supply them with medical care, supply them with energy, electricity, and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming ― is because of the effective use of data. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:50	<br><br>
	
So what is new about big data? What is the big deal? Well, to answer that question, let's think about what information looked like, physically looked like in the past. In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old. Now, there's inscriptions on this disc, but we actually don't know what it means. It's a complete mystery, but the point is that this is what information used to look like 4,000 years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:30	<br><br>
	
Now, society hasn't advanced all that much. We still store information on discs, but now we can store a lot more information, more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect, the data has gone from a stock to a flow, from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is, if you will, a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's 4,000 years old, is heavy, it doesn't store a lot of information, and that information is unchangeable. By contrast, all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail, and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. 	<br><br>

Now, one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on, but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think, for example, the question of location. Take, for example, Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the 1500s where Martin Luther was, we would have to follow him at all times, maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell, and record it, but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere, probably in a telecommunications carrier's database, there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times. If you have a cell phone, and that cell phone has GPS, but even if it doesn't have GPS, it can record your information. In this respect, location has been datafied. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:47	<br><br>
	
Now think, for example, of the issue of posture, the way that you are all sitting right now, the way that you sit, the way that you sit, the way that you sit. It's all different, and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back, and if I were to put sensors, maybe 100 sensors into all of your chairs right now, I could create an index that's fairly unique to you, sort of like a fingerprint, but it's not your finger. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:14	<br><br>
	
So what could we do with this? Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel, tries to stream off, but the car recognizes that a non-approved driver is behind the wheel, and maybe the engine just stops, unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say, "Hey, I have authorization to drive." Great. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:41	<br><br>
	
What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it? What could we do then? Maybe, if we aggregated the data, maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue, and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position, automatically knows, hey, set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel, honk inside to say, "Hey, wake up, pay more attention to the road." These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
So what is the value of big data? Well, think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do, we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers, so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won, because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub-program alongside it operating in the background, and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:29	<br><br>
	
And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self-driving cars? Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software? No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter, but that's not why. It's because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say, "Here's a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light, that that traffic light is red and not green, that that means that you need to stop and not go forward." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:17	<br><br>
	
Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online: search engines, Amazon's personalization algorithm, computer translation, voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies, cancerous biopsies, and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not, and sure enough, when you throw the data at it, through a machine-learning algorithm, the machine was able to identify the 12 telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem: The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for, but that the machine spotted. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:23	<br><br>
	
Now, there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives, but there are problems that we need to be conscious of, and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions, that the police may use big data for their purposes, a little bit like "Minority Report." Now, it's a term called predictive policing, or algorithmic criminology, and the idea is that if we take a lot of data, for example where past crimes have been, we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense, but the problem, of course, is that it's not simply going to stop on location data, it's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript? Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not, their credit score, their web-surfing behavior, whether they're up late at night. Their Fitbit, when it's able to identify biochemistries, will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do, and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age, the challenge will be safeguarding free will, moral choice, human volition, human agency. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:53	<br><br>
	
There is another problem: Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar, professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that person's job, as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person, is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now, we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short, temporary period of dislocation, and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live, the Industrial Revolution, because that's precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis: There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs, our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology, not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era, and honestly, we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data, and they misuse it too, and we need to get better at this, and this will take time. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool, but this is a tool that, unless we're careful, will burn us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health, but in the past, we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T, the technology, the hardware, because that's what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I, the information, which is less apparent, but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect, as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it, and that's why big data is a big deal. 	<br><br>

美国人最爱的馅饼是什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:15	<br><br>
	
观众：苹果派 	<br><br>
	
Kenneth Cukier：苹果派 毋庸置疑 我们是怎么知道的？ 因为数据 当你观察超市的销售数据 会发现超市销售的30厘米冷冻馅饼中 苹果派胜出, 毫无悬念 绝大多数的销售份额就是来自苹果派 但是之后超市开始销售 比较小的11厘米的馅饼 突然间苹果派的销量下降到了第4或第5名 为什么？怎么了？ 好, 想象一下 当你准备买一个30厘米的馅饼时 全家都不得不同意(选择苹果派馅饼) 虽然苹果派只是每个人的次选项 （笑声） 但当你给自己选一个11厘米馅饼时 你可以买你最爱吃的口味 你会选你的首选项 你有了更多数据 你可以知道些事情 这些事情在你只有少量数据时 你是无法知道的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:24	<br><br>
	
这里, 关键的是更多的数据 不单单让我们知道更多 知道更多我们正在关注的同样事物 更多的数据使我们能了解新的事情 让我们更好地了解 让我们有不同的视角 在这个例子里 更多的数据让我们知道 美国人最喜欢的馅饼 不是苹果派 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:49	<br><br>
	
你或许听说过大数据这个词 事实上, 你可能对这个词 已经心生厌恶 确实, 大数据受到了空前的宣传炒作 这很不应该 因为大数据是一个非常重要的工具 社会将由此而不断进步 过去我们习惯于处理小数据 思考这些小数据的意义 并以此来了解世界 现在我们有很多很多的数据 数据量前所未有的巨大 当我们掌握海量数据时 我们可以做一些事 一些在只有较少数据时不可能办到的事 大数据很重要, 它也是一个新兴事物 想象一下 能够帮助我们应对 世界性难题 像食物短缺 医疗短缺 能源短缺 电力短缺 还有确保人类家园 不会因为全球变暖而生灵涂炭 的唯一办法是有效利用大数据 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:50	<br><br>
	
那么大数据新在何处, 重在何处呢？ 为了回答这个问题, 让我们看一下 信息看上去是什么样的 信息在以前是什么样的 1908年在克里特岛上 (注：位于地中海 为希腊第一大岛) 考古学家发现了一个粘土做的盘子 这是个公元前2000年的盘子 距今约有4000年的历史 盘子上有铭文 但是我们不知道它们是什么意思 这完全是个谜团 但这就是4000年前 信息的样子 这就是当时社会 存储和传递信息的方式 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:30	<br><br>
	
现代社会也没有什么很大的进步 我们还是把数据存储在盘中 （注：指磁盘) 但我们可以存储更多的信息 远远超过以前的信息容量 这些信息搜索和复制起来更简单 分享和处理起来也更便捷 我们也可以重新利用这些数据 一些我们当初收集的时候 从来没有料想过的用途 从这个方面来说 数据已经从储存状态到了流动状态 从静态的统计性的数据 变成动态的数据流 这就是信息的流动性 克里特岛发现的粘土盘 有4000年的历史, 非常笨重 但它不能记录太多的信息 并且它所记录的信息是不能更改的 与此相反 爱德华・斯诺登从美国国家安全局 所获得的文件 可以放在一个 仅有指甲大小的存储盘里 并且可以以光速进行数据共享 更多数据 更多 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:50	<br><br>
	
今天我们有这么多数据的一个原因是 我们一直在收集信息 就像我们一直在做的一样 另一个原因是我们记录了 许多蕴含丰富信息的事物 但是从没把信息转换成数据形式 现在我们正在把信息转变成数据 举个例子, 定位问题 比如说马丁・路德 在16世纪 如果我们想知道 马丁・路德在哪里 我们必须一直跟着他 或许用羽毛笔和墨水 把这些情况记录下来 那现今是什么样的情形呢？ 在某些地方 可能在电信运营商的数据库里 有个电子数据表或者至少一个数据目录 记录着所有关于你 任何时候在什么地点的信息 如果你有个手机 这个手机有GPS, 或者即使没有GPS 它还是可以记录你的信息 从这方面来说, 位置信息被数据化了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:47	<br><br>
	
再举个例子, 关于姿势 你们现在坐着的姿势 你坐着的姿势 你坐着的姿势 你坐着的姿势 这些都不一样 这是一个关于腿长 你的背部和背部轮廓的函数 如果我现在放一些传感器 或许100个 在你的椅子里 我可以算出你的独一无二的参数 就像你的指纹 但不是针对你的手指 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:14	<br><br>
	
那我们能用它来干什么呢？ 东京的研究者把它 运用在一个汽车防盗设施的雏形上 它的设想是盗贼坐在驾驶座上 企图把车开走 但是汽车识别出 驾驶座上的是个未授权驾驶人 那汽车可能就会熄火 除非你在仪表盘上输入密码 来表明“我已获得授权” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:41	<br><br>
	
如果欧洲的每辆汽车 都装备了这项技术会是怎样的情形？ 我们还能做些什么呢？ 或许如果我们整合数据 我们可以识别示警信号 对于在下一个五秒钟内 可能发生的意外做出最佳预判 我们也可以进行数据化的是 司机的疲劳度 当汽车侦测到司机的坐姿 倒成某一特定姿势时 这个设备感知到并发出车内警告 可能是震动方向盘或语音提示 “嗨，醒醒 集中精神在路况上” 这就是生活的更多方面数据化后 我们能做的事情 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
那么大数据的价值在哪里？ 好 思考一下 你有了更多地信息 你可以做你以前不能做的事 在运用这个概念的领域里 让人印象最为最深刻的 是机器学习 机器学习是人工智能的一个分支 人工智能又是计算机科学的一个分支 它的基本理念是 把关于某个问题的一堆数据扔给电脑 让电脑自己找出解决方案 而不是教电脑应该做什么 通过机器学习的原型 可以帮助你来理解这个理念 20世纪50年代IBM的计算机科学家 亚瑟・塞缪尔想玩跳棋 所以他写了个程序 这样他就可以和电脑来玩 开始他下一盘 赢一盘 下一盘 赢一盘 下一盘 赢一盘 因为电脑只知道 规则允许怎样走 亚瑟・塞缪尔还知道其他东西 他知道下棋的策略 所以他又写了一个附加程序 这个程序在后台运行 它的功能只是计算概率 在一个给定的棋局里 每走一步后 会获胜或者失败的概率 再和电脑下棋 还是下一盘 赢一盘 下一盘 赢一盘 下一盘 赢一盘 后来亚瑟让电脑 自己和自己下棋 电脑自己玩的时候收集了更多的数据 收集的数据越多, 预测的准确率就越高 然后亚瑟又继续和电脑下棋 这次他下一盘 输一盘 下一盘 输一盘 下一盘 输一盘 亚瑟创造了一个机器 它的能力超越了亚瑟开始时所教给它的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:29	<br><br>
	
机器学习的理念 现在已经随处可见 你们觉得无人驾驶汽车(关键的技术)是什么？ 是不是把所有交通规则输入软件 就万事大吉了？不是 内存很便宜？不是 算法更快了 不是 处理器更强大了 不是 这些都有影响, 但不是真正的原因 真正的原因是我们改变了问题的本质 我们把问题的本质从 试图明确无误地 教会电脑怎样驾驶 变成我们对电脑说 “这里有许多关于汽车的数据 你自己搞定它 你知道那是交通信号灯 那是红灯不是绿灯 遇到红灯你必须停下来 不能往前走” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:17	<br><br>
	
机器学习是许多 网上在线应用的基础 搜索引擎 亚马逊的个性化算法 电脑智能翻译 语音识别系统 研究者最近在研究 关于活组织检查的问题 关于肿瘤活组织检查 他们让电脑 通过 (历史) 数据和存活率 来判断这些细胞 是否是癌症细胞 果不其然 当你把数据交给电脑 电脑通过自主学习 可以寻找出 12个最佳的鉴别特征用来预测 乳腺癌细胞的活检切片 确实是癌症细胞 问题是医学文献 只知道其中的九个鉴别特征 其他三个 人们不会去寻找 但是电脑把它们找了出来 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:23	<br><br>
	
大数据也有黑暗的一面 它可以改善我们的生活 但也会带来一些我们需要注意的问题 首先就是 我们可能因为预测的结果而受到惩罚 警察可能会用大数据来实现目标 有点像“少数派报告” 现在有个词叫做预见性监管 或者叫算法犯罪学 这个想法是如果我们掌握了大量数据 比如以往犯罪发生的地点 我们可以就知道把警力派到哪里 这很合理 但问题是 数据分析不会仅限于地点数据 它会进一步深入到个人层面 为什么我们不去分析 某人的中学成绩单 或者我们可以了解 他们的就职情况、信用记录 他们的上网行为 他们是否熬夜 当可以通过健康腕带读取生化数据时 就可以知道他们是否有激进的想法 我们可以用算法来预测 我们将要做什么 可能有些事情还没做 我们就要承担责任 个人隐私在小数据时代 是主要挑战 在大数据时代 这个挑战将会成为保卫自由意愿 道德选择 、人类意志 人类的能动性 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:53	<br><br>
	
还有另一个问题 大数据会偷走我们的工作 在21世纪 大数据和算法会威胁到 白领和需要专业知识的工作 就像在20世纪工厂自动化 和装配生产线的应用 威胁到了蓝领们的工作岗位 想象一下一个研究室技术员 他的工作就是通过一个显微镜 观察一个癌症活检组织 来判定它是不是癌症的 这个人上大学 买房子 他/她投票选举 他/她是这个社会的一份子 然后这个人的工作 还有其他 像他一样的专业人员 将会发现他们的工作被彻底改变了 或者彻底废除了 我们一直以为 在短时或者暂时的就业调整期后 一段时间内科技会创造就业机会 这对于我们所处的参考系 工业革命来说就是这样 因为在工业革命时期事情就是这样的 但是我们忘记了一件事情 有些类型的职业 已经彻底消失了并且再也不会回来 如果你是一匹马 工业革命不是一件好事 所以我们必须非常小心 根据我们的需求和整个人类的需求 来利用和适应大数据 我们必须是技术的主人 而不是技术的仆人 我们正在步入大数据时代 老实说, 我们并不能很好地 处理所有我们现在能够收集到的数据 这不仅仅是国家安全局的问题 许多企业也搜集并不恰当地使用数据 我们需要时间来纠正这个问题 这有点像原始人类面对火时 所面临的挑战 火是一种工具 但是如果使用不当就会引火烧身 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:55	<br><br>
	
大数据即将改变我们的生活方式 我们的工作方式和思考方式 它可以帮助我们管理事业 帮助我们过想要的满足、充满希望 幸福和健康的生活 但是在过去, 对于信息技术(IT) 我们经常只看到了T 就是技术、硬件 因为这是切实可见的东西 现在我们需要把目光放在 I 上 信息 它不是那么切实可见 但某种程度上却更加重要 在人类永无止境的探索过程中 我们可以从我们能收集的信息中 来了解这个世界 以及人类在这个世界中所处的地位 这就是为什么大数据非常重要 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">The state of the climate ― and what we might do about it</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
How can we begin to address the global, insidious problem of climate change ― a problem that’s too big for any one country to solve? Economist Nicholas Stern lays out a plan, presented to the UN’s Climate Summit in 2014, showing how the world’s countries can work together on climate. It’s a big vision for cooperation, with a payoff that goes far beyond averting disaster. He asks: How can we use this crisis to spur better lives for all? 	<br><br>

We are at a remarkable moment in time. We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:27	<br><br>
	
Let me illustrate with an example. I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People's University of China. China was getting serious about market economics and about university education, so they decided to call in the foreign experts. Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle. Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, it was a safe and easy way to get around. Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. When I was there last in the spring, there was an advisory for people of my age ― over 65 ― to stay indoors and not move much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:19	<br><br>
	
How did this come about? It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, from 10 million to 20 million. It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, particularly coal. China burns half the world's coal each year, and that's why, it is a key reason why, it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At the same time, we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. It has become the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. That's really important. But at the same time, the people of China are asking the question: What's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable? They've analyzed, diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. China's planning to scale back coal. It's looking to build its cities in different ways. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:28	<br><br>
	
Now, the growth of China is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, in the structure of the world economy. Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, the poorer countries of the world, were, notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people, they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. Now it's more than half; 25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw 25 years ago as developing. That's a remarkable change. It means that most countries around the world, rich or poor, are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:09	<br><br>
	
Now, the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. Fifty percent now in urban areas. That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050. Over the next two decades, we'll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent, and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land, on our water and on our forests. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:43	<br><br>
	
This is profound structural change. If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way, we will create waste, pollution, congestion, destruction of land and forests. If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers ― cities, energy, land ― if we manage all that badly, then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. And more than that, the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise, with immense risks to our climate. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. If we go on increasing those concentrations, we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. We've been around as Homo sapiens ― that's a rather generous definition, sapiens ― for perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million. We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. It would lead to changing deserts, changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes, changing sea levels, hundreds of millions of people, perhaps billions of people who would have to move, and if we've learned anything from history, that means severe and extended conflict. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:22	<br><br>
	
And we couldn't just turn it off. You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. You're in there. You're stuck. Those are the stakes we're playing for, and that's why we have to make this second transformation, the climate transformation, and move to a low-carbon economy. Now, the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic, or structural, transformation. But the second of the transformations, the climate transformations, we have to decide to do. Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. Now, the more I've thought about this, the two transformations coming together, the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified: cities, energy and land. And let me start with cities. I've already described the problems of Beijing: pollution, congestion, waste and so on. Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:36	<br><br>
	
Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities, you have to think ahead. The cities that are going to be built ― and there are many, and many big ones ― we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time and we can save energy. The cities that already are there, well established, we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities, and make it easier, encourage more people, to live closer to the center. We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. The bus rapid transport system in Bogota in Colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non-polluting way in a city: very frequent buses, strongly protected routes, the same service, really, as an underground railway system, but much, much cheaper and can be done much more quickly, a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:38	<br><br>
	
Now, some things in cities do take time. Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. Take my hometown, London. In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people and badly damaged the lives of many, many more. And it happened all the time. For those of you live outside London in the U.K. will remember it used to be called The Smoke. That's the way London was. By regulating coal, within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. I remember the smogs well. When the visibility dropped to [less] than a few meters, they stopped the buses and I had to walk. This was the 1950s. I had to walk home three miles from school. Again, breathing was a hazardous activity. But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. Good decisions can bring good results, striking results, quickly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:32	<br><br>
	
We've seen more: In London, we've introduced the congestion charge, actually quite quickly and effectively, and we've seen great improvements in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system. You can see that the two transformations I've described, the structural and the climate, come very much together. But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities, and we have to invest wisely, and if we do, we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities, more attractive cities, more productive cities, and stronger community in those cities ― public transport, recycling, reusing, all sorts of things that bring communities together. We can do that, but we have to think, we have to invest, we have to plan. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:17	<br><br>
	
Let me turn to energy. Now, energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent. Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so. We have to invest strongly in energy, we have to use it much more efficiently, and we have to make it clean. We can see how to do that. Take the example of California. It would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent. I don't want to start any ― (Laughter) California's a big place. (Laughter) In the next five or six years, they will likely move from around 20 percent in renewables ― wind, solar and so on ― to over 33 percent, and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to where they were in 1990, a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. That's a striking achievement. It shows what can be done. Not just California ― the incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India. They've set themselves a target of five years. I think they've got a good chance of doing that. We'll see, but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. Four hundred million, more than the population of the United States. Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. Again, you can see good decisions can bring quick results, and those two transformations, the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon, are intimately intertwined. Do the first one well, the structural, the second one on the climate becomes much easier. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:16	<br><br>
	
Look at land, land and particularly forests. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, fundamental to the tackling of climate change. But we're losing our forests. In the last decade, we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal, and much more has been degraded. But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. We can recognize the problem, but we can also understand how to tackle it. In Brazil, the rate of deforestation has been reduced by 70 percent over the last 10 years. How? By involving local communities, investing in their agriculture and their economies, by monitoring more carefully, by enforcing the law more strictly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:11	<br><br>
	
And it's not just stopping deforestation. That's of course of first and fundamental importance, but it's also regrading degraded land, regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land. I first went to Ethiopia in 1967. It was desperately poor. In the following years, it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. Over the last few years, actually more than a few, Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. It has ambitions to be a middle-income country 15 years from now and to be carbon neutral. Again, I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. You're seeing that commitment there. You're seeing what can be done. Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. It's working in the rehabilitation of land. In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia, a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
So we can see, from Beijing to London, from California to India, from Brazil to Ethiopia, we do understand how to manage those two transformations, the structural and the climate. We do understand how to manage those well. And technology is changing very rapidly. I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this, but you can see the electric cars, you can see the batteries using new materials. You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away. You can see better insulation. And there's much more coming. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:56	<br><br>
	
But, and it's a big but, the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should. We're not managing those structural transformations as we can. The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet. The depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet. We need political pressure to build. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth, better climate, a better world. We can make, by managing those two transformations well, the next 100 years the best of centuries. If we make a mess of it, we, you and me, if we make a mess of it, if we don't manage those transformations properly, it will be, the next 100 years will be the worst of centuries. That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, and I co-chaired that with him, and we handed that report yesterday here in New York, in the United Nations Building to the Secretary-General of the U.N., Ban Ki-moon. We know that we can do this. 	<br><br>

Now, two weeks ago, I became a grandfather for the fourth time. Our daughter ― (Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) ― Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa. (Applause) Two weeks old. Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues, that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities, and still we failed to act? Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years the best of centuries. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">The magic of the Amazon: A river that flows invisibly all around us </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The Amazon River is like a heart, pumping water from the seas through it, and up into the atmosphere through 600 billion trees, which act like lungs. Clouds form, rain falls and the forest thrives. In a lyrical talk, Antonio Donato Nobre talks us through the interconnected systems of this region, and how they provide environmental services to the entire world. A parable for the extraordinary symphony that is nature. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">What's the next window into our universe?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Big Data is everywhere ― even the skies. In an informative talk, astronomer Andrew Connolly shows how large amounts of data are being collected about our universe, recording it in its ever-changing moods. Just how do scientists capture so many images at scale? It starts with a giant telescope … 	<br><br>
 Andrew Connolly	<br><br>

So in 1781, an English composer, technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did. And Herschel's recognition that something was different, that something wasn't quite right, was the discovery of a planet, the planet Uranus, a name that has entertained countless generations of children, but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system. Just last month, NASA announced the discovery of 517 new planets in orbit around nearby stars, almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy. So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data, and with data almost doubling every year, within the next two decades, me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
But as we enter this era of big data, what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different, capable of changing the questions we want to ask, and this difference is not about how much data we collect, it's whether those data open new windows into our universe, whether they change the way we view the sky. So what is the next window into our universe? What is the next chapter for astronomy? Well, I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we're going to develop over the next decade, and how these technologies, together with the smart use of data, may once again transform astronomy by opening up a window into our universe, the window of time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:52	<br><br>
	
Why time? Well, time is about origins, and it's about evolution. The origins of our solar system, how our solar system came into being, is it unusual or special in any way? About the evolution of our universe. Why our universe is continuing to expand, and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:13	<br><br>
	
But first, I want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky. So imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern Chile looking out to the west towards the Pacific Ocean a few hours before sunrise. This is the view of the night sky that you would see, and it's a beautiful view, with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon. but it's also a static view, and in many ways, this is the way we think of our universe: eternal and unchanging. But the universe is anything but static. It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge, they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born, they die, they explode in these extravagant displays. In fact, if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile, and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year, the pulsations that you see are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star exploding, brightening and then fading from view, each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun, so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time. Ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it, it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. Now, if we fade out the supernovae, it's not just brightness that changes. Our sky is in constant motion. This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun, and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe, to predict its future and to explain its past. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale. The Hubble Space Telescope: for the last 25 years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe, but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images, about 120 years to do this just once. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes, telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible, telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or the LSST, possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy, in fact proof, if you should need it, that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer to name anything, not even your children. (Laughter) We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform our views of the universe, because one image from the LSST is equivalent to 3,000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope, each image three and a half degrees on the sky, seven times the width of the full moon. Well, how do you capture an image at this scale? Well, you build the largest digital camera in history, using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the High Street, but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across, about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, where one image is three billion pixels. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution, just a single LSST image, it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens. And this camera will image the sky, taking a new picture every 20 seconds, constantly scanning the sky so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope, it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies, and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now, we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects, but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 10 years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept, looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science, changing the way that we do astronomy, to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data, where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the cameras that we've built. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:13	<br><br>
	
Now, thousands of discoveries will come from this project, but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
In the last five years, NASA has discovered over 1,000 planetary systems around nearby stars, but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system, and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed? And if we want to answer that question, we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail, and it's the details that are crucial. So now, if we look back at the sky, at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky, these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system. The positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter were much closer to the sun, and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system, they were scattering the asteroids in their wake. So studying the asteroids is like performing forensics, performing forensics on our solar system, but to do this, we need distance, and we get the distance from the motion, and we get the motion because of our access to time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:35	<br><br>
	
So what does this tell us? Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen, these are the asteroids that are moving fastest, because they're closest to us, closest to Earth. These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals, but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth, like happened 60 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs, or just at the beginning of the last century, when an asteroid wiped out almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest, or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia, releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb. So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past, it can also predict the future, including our future. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:25	<br><br>
	
Now when we get distance, we get to see the asteroids in their natural habitat, in orbit around the sun. So every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid. Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky. The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids, dry and stony in the center, water-rich and primitive towards the edge, water-rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the Earth at an earlier time. Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide, we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system, to asteroids beyond the orbits of Neptune and Mars, to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. And as we increase the detail of this picture, increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100, we will be able to answer questions such as, is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune, to find Earth-impacting asteroids long before they're a danger, and to find out whether, maybe, our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars, and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system, and maybe that's one of the reasons why solar systems like ours seem to be so rare. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:53	<br><br>
	
Now, distance and changes in our universe ― distance equates to time, as well as changes on the sky. Every foot of distance you look away, or every foot of distance an object is away, you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time, and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe, not once but multiple times. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
The first time was in 1929, when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding, leading to the ideas of the Big Bang. And the observations were simple: just 24 galaxies and a hand-drawn picture. But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy, the faster it was receding, was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:50	<br><br>
	
A second revolution happened 70 years later, when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding, it was accelerating, a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets, the faster it moves away. And they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae, and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance. And these observations were more complex. They required new technologies and new telescopes, because the supernovae were in galaxies that were 2,000 times more distant than the ones used by Hubble. And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae, because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. Three years to find 42 supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies. And once they'd collected their data, this is what they found. Now, this may not look impressive, but this is what a revolution in physics looks like: a line predicting the brightness of a supernova 11 billion light years away, and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:05	<br><br>
	
Small changes give rise to big consequences. Small changes allow us to make discoveries, like the planet found by Herschel. Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head. So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint, meaning slightly further away, requiring that a universe must not just be expanding, but this expansion must be accelerating, revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy, a component that drives this expansion and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget of our universe today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:45	<br><br>
	
So what is the next revolution likely to be? Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist? Each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be, showing the properties of dark energy. They all are consistent with the 42 points, but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different. Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time, or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky. Others make differences and changes to the physics at the sub-atomic level. Or, they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work, or they say our universe is just one of many, part of this mysterious multiverse, but all of these ideas, all of these theories, amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy, but all of them consistent with our 42 points. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:44	<br><br>
	
So how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade? Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice, and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair. One roll of the dice would tell you very little, but the more times you rolled them, the more data you collected, the more confident you would become, not just whether they're loaded or fair, but by how much, and in what way. It took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky. With the LSST, we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation, it will find 10 times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. This will increase by 1,000 within the first four months: 1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey, each supernova a roll of the dice, each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent, and which ones are not. And so, by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology, we'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030, we would expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe, a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe, to gradually emerge. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:25	<br><br>
	
Now, in many ways, the questions that I posed are in reality the simplest of questions. We may not know the answers, but we at least know how to ask the questions. But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed 42 supernovae that turned our understanding of the universe on its head, when we're working with billions of galaxies, how many more times are we going to find 42 points that don't quite match what we expect? Like the planet found by Herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity, all ideas that came because the data didn't quite match what we expected. What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is, we don't even know how many answers are out there waiting, answers about our origins and our evolution. How many answers are out there that we don't even know the questions that we want to ask? 	<br><br>

If you’re raised on dogma and hate, can you choose a different path? Zak Ebrahim was just seven years old when his father helped plan the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. His story is shocking, powerful and, ultimately, inspiring. 	<br><br>

On November 5th, 1990, a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder, but while serving time on lesser charges, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters. Thankfully, those plans were foiled by an FBI informant. Sadly, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not. Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot. El-Sayyid Nosair is my father. 	<br><br>

I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer, and a loving American mother and grade school teacher, who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me. It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change. My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see. It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another, it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part, we all want the same things out of life. However, in every religion, in every population, you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do. 	<br><br>

A few months prior to his arrest, he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends, he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice. He told me I'd be going with him the next morning. We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range, which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI. When it was my turn to shoot, my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off. That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flames. My uncle turned to the other men, and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh." Like father, like son. They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny. They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of. Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others. These were the men I looked up to. These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle. 	<br><br>

By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends. Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town. Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies. I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted, but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition. So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games. For those reasons, my social skills were lacking, to say the least, and growing up in a bigoted household, I wasn't prepared for the real world. I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a person's race or religion. 	<br><br>

So what opened my eyes? One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections. Through a college prep program, I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia. My particular group's focus was on youth violence, and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life, this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate. The members of our group came from many different walks of life. One day toward the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish. Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us. I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable. Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens, an amusement park. There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character. Most of my life, I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, that all gay people were a negative influence. As chance would have it, I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there, and soon found that many were the kindest, least judgmental people I had ever met. Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others, and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated. Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction. I don't know what it's like to be gay, but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
Then there was "The Daily Show." On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person's race, religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character. He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one. Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:04	<br><br>
	
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change, and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live. She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said, "I'm tired of hating people." In that instant, I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name. I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life. So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger? Well, that's simple. I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that although I had been subjected to this violent, intolerant ideology, that I did not become fanaticized. Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism, against the bigotry. I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives. For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions. And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father. I am not my father. 	<br><br>

1990 年 11 月 5 日， 一位名叫埃尔・塞伊德・诺塞尔的男子 走入曼哈顿的一间宾馆 刺杀了拉比梅厄 卡赫纳， 犹太防卫联盟的首领。 诺塞尔一开始并未被指认参与谋杀， 但当他因小事入狱服刑期间， 他和一些人开始计划袭击 纽约市的一些地标， 包括隧道，犹太教会堂 和联合国总部。 谢天谢地，这些计划被 美国联邦调查局的线人挫败了。 不幸的是，1993 年 世贸中心的那场爆炸袭击却发生了。 诺塞尔最终被指控 参与这场犯罪谋划。 埃尔・塞伊德・诺塞尔是我的父亲。 	<br><br>

我 1983 年出生在 宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡， 我的父亲是一位 埃及裔工程师， 我有个爱我的美国母亲， 她是一名小学老师， 他们尽最大的努力 为给我创造出欢乐的童年。 直到我 7 岁的时候 家庭氛围开始出现了变化。 我的父亲让我接触伊斯兰的一支 很少人见过，包括大部分的穆斯林， 都没见过的一个派别。 我的人生经验告诉我 人们与彼此相处， 很快就意识到，很大程度上 人们对生活有着相同的追求。 然而，所有宗教，所有群体， 你总能看到一小部分人 对他们的信仰太过狂热 以至于认为他们应该用各种方法 让其他人和他们过同样的生活。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:54	<br><br>
	
在他被捕前的几个月， 他和我坐着聊天解释到 在过去的几个周末， 他和他的一些朋友 在长岛（美国纽约州东南部岛屿） 进行目标射击训练。 他让我第二天一早和他一起去。 我们来到凯佛顿射击场， 我们并不知道自己已经 被联邦调查局监视了。 轮到我射击的时候， 我的父亲帮我扶住 肩膀上的来福戗， 并教导我如何瞄准 30 码处的目标。 那天，我射出的最后一颗子蛋 打中了目标顶上的橙色亮光， 所有人都惊呆了，尤其是我， 整个目标版燃烧了。 我的叔叔转向旁边的人， 用阿拉伯语说到，“Ibn abuh”―― 虎父无犬子。 他们当场开怀大笑起来， 几年后 我才了解他们大笑的原因， 他们以为我和我的父亲有着 同样的摧毁能力。 这群男人最终被指控 将满载 1500 磅重的 炸弹的厢式货车 停在世界贸易中心北塔的 地下停车场， 爆炸造成 6 人死亡， 同时致使超过 1000 人受伤。 这些是我曾经敬仰的人。 这些是我曾经称呼其为 ammu， 意为叔叔的人。 	<br><br>

当我 19 岁的时候， 我已经搬超过 20 次家了， 童年所经历的不稳定 并未给我 结交朋友的机会。 每当我感到和附近人相熟时， 就是我要收拾行囊 去下一个地方的时候。 作为永远的班级新生， 我常是同学们欺负的对象。 为了不被同班同学欺负， 我将自己的身份保密， 但结果是，作为 安静又胖乎乎的新同学 很轻易就成为被欺负的对象。 所以更多的时候， 我待在家里 看书看电视 或者是打电动。 正因为这样，我的社交能力有所缺失， 简单地说， 成长在固执的家庭， 我没有准备好应对现实世界。 我被教育成用武断的方式， 依据人们的脸或宗教， 来评断他人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:17	<br><br>
	
什么让我开了眼界呢？ 某次经历 挑战了我思考的方式 发生于 2000 年美国总统竞选期间。 在预科期间， 我参与了 在费城举办的全国青年大会。 我这组的话题是关于青少年暴力， 作为倍受欺负的受害者， 这个话题我很感兴趣。 组员都有着不同的生活轨迹。 大会临近结束的某天， 我发现我的某个朋友 是犹太人。 我也是过了几天 才知晓这件事情， 我认识到，我们之间 并没有与生俱来的仇恨。 我从未有过犹太朋友， 坦白地说，我为此感到骄傲， 能够跨越 我人生绝大部分时间 认为是不可能逾越的障碍。 另一个转折点是， 某年暑假，我在布希花园 这个主题乐园打工。 我见识到有着不同信仰， 来自不同文化的人们， 这样的经验 对我的人格发展 是至关重要的。 因为在过去的日子， 我接收到的教育是， 同性恋是罪恶的， 据此推断， 所有的同性恋者都有着 消极的影响。 在我打暑期工的时间里， 我有机会和同性恋演员 一起合作， 我很快发现，很多同性恋者 是我所见过最善良， 最自由开放尊重他人的人。 在儿童时期被欺负的经历 教给我要对他人的遭遇 感到同情和怜悯， 对我来说， 我会善待那些 对我好的人。 因为这样的感受，我能够 用真实生活和交际经历来 抵挡从孩童时期就被灌输的成见。 我不知道作为同性恋者的感受， 但我熟知那种被 无法掌控的事物所评断的感受。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
接着，有个“每日秀”的节目出现了。 每一晚，乔恩・斯图尔特催促我 诚实面对自己的偏见， 帮助我认识到一个人的种族， 信仰和性取向 对这个人的人格没有任何关系。 某种程度上说， 每当我迫切需要一个父亲的时候， 他就在那里。 鼓舞人心之事 往往来自你无法预知的地方， 事实上，一个犹太裔喜剧明星 积极地影响我的世界观， 比我那极端的亲生父亲 多得多。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:04	<br><br>
	
某天，我和母亲谈到 我的世界观正在改变， 她对我说， 我将在生命里 一直带着尊重的心。 她用疲倦的眼神看着我， 她受够了 被教条主义侵占的人生， 说到：“我不愿憎恨他人了。” 瞬间，我意识到，在内心里承受憎恨 需要多么巨大的负能量。 	<br><br>

扎克 伊博黑姆不是我的本名。 当我的家人决定 和我父亲断绝关系时 我改了这个名字 以开始新的生活。 那么，我为什么要 出现在公众视线前 将自己置于可能的危险境地呢？ 嗯，这很容易解释。 我这样做是希望也许某人某天 当他决定使用武力 反抗社会的时候 可能会听到我的故事，并意识到 有比动武更好的方法， 尽管我曾被灌输 这样的暴力思维， 偏狭的意识， 我并没有为其所动。 而是选择通过自己的经验 来抵抗恐怖主义， 来反对偏见。 我为了那些恐怖袭击的受害者 以及他们的亲人而这样做， 为了那些被恐怖主义活动所造成的 生命的苦痛和损失而这样做。 为了那些遭受恐怖袭击的 受害者，我站出来 反对这些毫无意义的袭击行动， 谴责我父亲的行为。 就是这样简单的原因， 我站在这里证明 暴力不是宗教或种族与生俱来的， 儿子并不需要走上 和父亲相同的道路。 我不是我的父亲。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">A Magna Carta for the web</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web 25 years ago. So it’s worth a listen when he warns us: There’s a battle ahead. Eroding net neutrality, filter bubbles and centralizing corporate control all threaten the web’s wide-open spaces. It’s up to users to fight for the right to access and openness. The question is, What kind of Internet do we want? 	<br><br>
Tim Berners-Lee	<br><br>
	
 Aug 2014 	<br><br>

TED is 30. The world wide web is celebrating this month its 25th anniversary. So I've got a question for you. Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future. Let's talk about the state. Let's talk about what sort of a web we want. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:29	<br><br>
	
So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN. I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project. I wrote the code. I was I suppose the first user. There was a lot of concern that people didn't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated. A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people, and bit by bit, it worked. It took off. It was pretty cool. And in fact, a few years later in 2000, five percent of the world population were using the world wide web. In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent. In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure. And now here we are in 2014, and 40 percent of the world are using the world wide web, and counting. Obviously it's increasing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:25	<br><br>
	
I want you to think about both sides of that. Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED, the first question you ask is, what can we do to get the other 60 percent on board as quickly as possible? Lots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile. But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent, because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web-enabled life, you don't remember things anymore, you just look them up, then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. But in fact, yeah, it's been a success, there's lots of things, Khan Academy for crying out loud, there's Wikipedia, there's a huge number of free e-books that you can read online, lots of wonderful things for education, things in many areas. Online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether, made types of commerce available which weren't available at all before. Commerce has been almost universally affected. Government, not universally affected, but very affected, and on a good day, lots of open data, lots of e-government, so lots of things which are visible happening on the web. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:33	<br><br>
	
Also, lots of things which are less visible. The healthcare, late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have, when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country. Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there, and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy. So we cannot assume that part of the web, part of the deal with the web, is when I use the web, it's just a transparent, neutral medium. I can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening, without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data. So in fact, something we realized, we can't just use the web, we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing, is it in fact of a quality that we need? We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech. We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people can see our tweets, except when they can't, except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country, or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves, the state of the country we live in, which isn't available to anybody else. So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down, that the web is opened up where there is censorship. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
We love the fact that the web is open. It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody. It doesn't matter who we are. And then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos, so that it's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one, so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves. And we also have, if you've read the book about the filter bubble, the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like. So we love it when we're bathed in what things we like to click on, and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world called a filter bubble. So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
What sort of web do you want? I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces, as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance. I want a web which has got, for example, is a really good basis for democracy. I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data, clinical data is available to scientists to do research. I want a web where the other 60 percent get on board as fast as possible. I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens, some disaster strikes, that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:44	<br><br>
	
So this is just some of the things that I want, from a big list, obviously it's longer. You have your list. I want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want. You can go to webat25.org and find some links. There are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Magna Carta, a bill of rights for the web. How about we do that? How about we decide, these are, in a way, becoming fundamental rights, the right to communicate with whom I want. What would be on your list for that Magna Carta? Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web. Let's do that this year. Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary to crowdsource a Magna Carta to the web. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
Thank you. And do me a favor, will you? Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks. 	<br><br>

TED三十岁了 这个月万维网也将庆祝 它的25岁生日 因此我要问你们一个问题 我们来谈谈这段旅程 主要关于未来的 来谈谈这个国家 来谈谈哪种互联网是我们想要的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:29	<br><br>
	
25年前 我还在欧洲核子研究中心工作 一年后我终于得到了许可 将它主要地当作一个编外项目来做 我写下了代码 我想我应该是第一个用户 当时很担心 因为它太过复杂 别们也许不愿意将它继续下去 通过大量劝说 与他人通力合作 逐渐 它走上正轨 它正式上线 真是太酷了 事实上 几年之后的2000年 全世界人口中的5% 都在使用万维网 又过了7年 到2007年 上升到了17% 2008年 我们建立了万维网基金会 部分原因是考虑到这一点 还有就是担心这个数字 现在我们步入2014年 全世界人口中的40% 都在使用万维网 显然这个数字仍在增长 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:25	<br><br>
	
我希望你们从两方面考虑一下这件事 显然 对于现场观众来说 要问的第一个问题就是 我们要怎样做 才能尽可能快的 让剩下的60%也加入到万维网？ 要依靠很多设备 显然需要移动设备 但我希望你们也想一下那40%的人 因为如果你自己 生活在一个能够轻易上网的环境中 你不再需要记忆什么东西 只要上上网就能查到想要的 你可能会觉得这是一个成功 然后我们就可以悠闲地生活 但事实上 的确 这是一个成功 互联网上有很多东西 有可汗学院 还有维基百科 这里有大量的免费电子书 可供你在线阅读 这里有大量关于教育的东西 有各个领域的东西 电子商务在某些情况下 彻底颠覆了整个商业活动的运作方式 使得各种之前不可行的商业类型 变得可行 商业几乎全都受到了影响 政府 没有全受到影响 但也受到很大影响 然后某一天 会出现大量开放数据 和网上政府 很多事在网络上 都是显而易见的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:33	<br><br>
	
同样 也有很多事情不那么明显 比如 医疗方面的信息 人们在夜里 为他们所关心的人可能会患有 哪种癌症而忧心忡忡 或人们通过互联网 与身处异国的亲友聊天 这些信息不需要被别人看到 事实上他们需要一定的隐私 因此我们不能假设互联网的一部分 互联网使用过程中的一部分 就是当我使用网络时的 它仅仅是一个透明的 中性的介质 我可以通过它与你交谈 不用担心 那些实际上我们知道正在发生的事 不用去担心 自己不仅会受到监控 还会受到一些可能滥用数据的人监控 所以实际上 我们意识到了一些事 我们并不只是使用互联网 还不得不担心 整个的底层基础结构 实际上达到我们所需的质量了吗？ 我们得意于我们拥有这种极好的言论自由 我们可以发微博 很多人 可以看到我们发的内容 除非他上不了 除非他们国家屏蔽了推特 某种程度上 我们在试图表达自己的过程中 加入了一些关于自己状态 关于我们生活的国家的状态的信息 而这些信息不能给别人看 因此我们必须抗议并确保 审查制度被废除 要让存在审查制度 地方的网络保持开放 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
我们热爱互联网是开放的这一事实 它让我们交谈 任何一个人都能与他人交谈 不管我们是谁都无所谓 然后我们加入那些 飞速成立的 大型社交网络公司 这使得跟同一社交网络中的人交谈 比跟不同社交网络中的人交谈 要容易很多 所以事实上 我们有时会限制住自己 而且 如果你读过关于“过滤泡沫”的书 过滤泡沫现象就是 我们爱借助机器 帮自己找到喜欢的东西 因此 我们爱沉浸在 自己点击进去的内容里 机器自动为我们提供 我们喜欢的东西 然后我们 最后会觉得这个世界十分美好 这就叫做过滤泡沫 这里存在一些可能威胁到 我们现有的社交网络的东西 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
哪种的互联网是你想要的？ 我希望互联网不会分裂成很多碎片 就像一些国家一直暗示 他们应该对最近的监控事件做出反应 我希望互联网拥有 比如说 一个良好的民主的基础 我希望能在互联网上 接受隐私有保障的医疗服务 网上有许多健康数据 临床数据 可供科学家做研究 我希望另外60%的人 也能尽快加入互联网 我想要的互联网创新强有力的基础 当一些不好的事情发生时 当灾难垄来时 我们可以 迅速应对 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:44	<br><br>
	
以上只是我所愿望清单的一部分 很明显这份清单很长 你们也有自己的清单 我希望我们利用这个25周年纪念 去思考一下我们想要什么样的网络 你可以登陆webat25.org 找到一些链接 很多网站上 人们已经开始起草一部大宪章 一部关于互联网权益的法案 我们要怎么做？ 我们如何决策 这些 在某种程度上 会成为基本权利 与我想要交流的人去交流的权利 你想要在这样一部大宪章中加入哪些条目呢？ 让我们共同完成一部 互联网大宪章 让我们今年就开始做 让我们借25周年纪念的能量 将大宪章众包 给互联网（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
谢谢 请帮我一个忙 可以吗？ 请为我而战 好吗？谢谢 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">The dark secrets of a surveillance state</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Tour the deep dark world of the East German state security agency known as Stasi. Uniquely powerful at spying on its citizens, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the Stasi masterminded a system of surveillance and psychological pressure that kept the country under control for decades. Hubertus Knabe studies the Stasi ― and was spied on by them. He shares stunning details from the fall of a surveillance state, and shows how easy it was for neighbor to turn on neighbor. 	<br><br>
Hubertus Knabe	<br><br>
 Aug 2014 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
This year, Germany is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany. In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away, the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later, the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany. Among many other things, Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi. Only two years after its dissolution, its documents were opened to the public, and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state functioned. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:06	<br><br>
	
Perhaps you have watched the movie "The Lives of Others." This movie made the Stasi known worldwide, and as we live in an age where words such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping" are on the front pages of newspapers, I would like to speak about how the Stasi really worked. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:30	<br><br>
	
At the beginning, let's have a short look at the history of the Stasi, because it's really important for understanding its self-conception. Its origins are located in Russia. In 1917, the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, shortly Cheka. It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies. It evolved later into the well-known KGB. The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers. They called themselves Chekists, and even the emblem was very similar, as you can see here. In fact, the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi. When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945, it immediately expanded there, and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police. By the way, in this hall where we are now, the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:52	<br><br>
	
Five years later, the Stasi was established, and step by step, the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it. For instance, the central jail for political prisoners, which was established by the Russians, was taken over by the Stasi and used until the end of Communism. You see it here. At the beginning, every important step took place under the attendance of the Russians. But the Germans are known to be very effective, so the Stasi grew very quickly, and already in 1953, it had more employees than the Gestapo had, the secret police of Nazi Germany. The number doubled in each decade. In 1989, more than 90,000 employees worked for the Stasi. This meant that one employee was responsible for 180 inhabitants, which was really unique in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:53	<br><br>
	
At the top of this tremendous apparatus, there was one man, Erich Mielke. He ruled the Ministry of State Security for more than 30 years. He was a scrupulous functionary ― in his past, he killed two policemen not far away from here ― who in fact personalized the Stasi. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:16	<br><br>
	
But what was so exceptional about the Stasi? Foremost, it was its enormous power, because it united different functions in one organization. First of all, the Stasi was an intelligence service. It used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly, such as informers, or tapping phones, as you can see it on the picture here. And it was not only active in East Germany, but all over the world. Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police. It could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons. Thirdly, the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor. It had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially. Last but not least, the Stasi had its own armed forces. More than 11,000 soldiers were serving in its so-called Guards Regiment. It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings. Due to this concentration of power, the Stasi was called a state in the state. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:36	<br><br>
	
But let's look in more and more detail at the tools of the Stasi. Please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented. Of course, the Stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people. Telephones were wiretapped, including the phone of the German chancellor in the West, and often also the apartments. Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened by these machines. The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took. In this picture, you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent. The Stasi even collected the smell of people. It stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution. For all these tasks, highly specialized departments were responsible. The one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters, for good reasons, because if one agent quit the Stasi, his knowledge was very small. Contrast that with Snowden, for example. But the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation. The agent who shadowed me didn't know who I was or why I was surveyed. In fact, I smuggled forbidden books from West to East Germany. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
But what was even more typical for the Stasi was the use of human intelligence, people who reported secretly to the Stasi. For the Minister of State Security, these so-called unofficial employees were the most important tools. From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people collaborated constantly with the Stasi, more than one percent of the population. And in a way, the minister was right, because technical instruments can only register what people are doing, but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking. Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants. The system of how to get them and how to educate them, as it was called, was very sophisticated. The Stasi had its own university, not far away from here, where the methods were explored and taught to the officers. This guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens. Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured to becoming one, but that's mostly not true, because a forced informant is a bad informant. Only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower. The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits. The officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant, and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows that it's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others. Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany collaborated with the Stasi, as for instance Ibrahim Bohme. In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR until it came out that he was an informant. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
The net of spies was really broad. In nearly every institution, even in the churches or in West Germany, there were many of them. I remember telling a leading Stasi officer, "If you had sent an informant to me, I would surely have recognized him." His answer was, "We didn't send anyone. We took those who were around you." And in fact, two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi. Not only in my case, informers were very close. For example, Vera Lengsfeld, another leading dissident, in her case it was her husband who spied on her. A famous writer was betrayed by his brother. This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell, where the only apparently trustable person was an informer. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:53	<br><br>
	
But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives? The main purpose was to control the society. In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who, which meant who thinks what. He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime. He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning. The East Germans knew, of course, that they were surrounded by informers, in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear, the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
That's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime. If yes, the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung, and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally "biodegradation." But actually, it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people, for example by damaging their reputation, by organizing failures in their work, and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them, and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions. Detaining someone was used only as a last resort. For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons, one in every district. Here, the Stasi also developed quite modern methods of detention. Normally, the interrogation officer didn't torture the prisoner. Instead, he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central. Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony. If you have the occasion, do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:38	<br><br>
	
One more question needs to be answered: If the Stasi were so well organized, why did the Communist regime collapse? First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany was uncertain what to do against the growing protest of people. It was especially confused because in the mother country of socialism, the Soviet Union, a more liberal policy took place. In addition, the regime was dependent on the loans from the West. Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising was given to the Stasi. Secondly, in the Communist ideology, there's no place for criticism. Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system, and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course. The consequence was that despite all the information, the regime couldn't analyze its real problems, and therefore it couldn't solve them. In the end, the Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
The ending of the Stasi was something tragic, because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing: to destroy the documents they had produced during decades. Fortunately, they had been stopped by human rights activists. That's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:25	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:27	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:35	<br><br>
	
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much. So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions because I have here Der Spiegel from last week. "Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA. And you just told us about my neighbor, the spies and the informant from East Germany. So there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn't? What's your reaction as a historian when you see this? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:04	<br><br>
	
Hubertus Knabe: I think there are several aspects to mention. At first, I think there's a difference of why you are collecting this data. Are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks, or are you doing that for oppressing your people? So that makes a fundamental difference. But on the other hand, also in a democracy, these instruments can be abused, and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that, and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have. The third point, probably, we really can be happy that we live in a democracy, because you can be sure that Russia and China are doing the same, but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:53	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:00	<br><br>
	
BG: When the story came out first, last July, last year, you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribunal. Why? HK: Yeah, I did so because of the second point I mentioned, that I think especially in a democracy, the rules are for everybody. They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules. In the criminal code of Germany, it's written that it's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge. Fortunately, it's written in the criminal code of Germany, so if it's not respected, then I think an investigation is necessary, and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of Germany started this, and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel, and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:52	<br><br>
	
BG: That doesn't surprise me because ― (Applause) ― because of the story you told. Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany, and I expected the Germans to react much more strongly, immediately. And instead, the reaction really came only when Chancellor Merkel was revealed as being wiretapped. Why so? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:16	<br><br>
	
HK: I take it as a good sign, because people feel secure in this democracy. They aren't afraid that they will be arrested, and if you leave this hall after the conference, nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you. So that's a good sign, I think. People are not really scared, as they could be. But of course, I think, the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in Germany or wherever they happen. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:47	<br><br>
	
BG: A personal question, and this is the last one. There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden. Would you be in favor or against? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:57	<br><br>
	
HK: Oh, that's a difficult question, but if you ask me, and if I answer honestly, I would give him the asylum, because I think it was really brave what he did, and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything. So I think, for these people, we should do something, and especially if you see the German history, where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn't get it, so it would be a good sign to give him asylum. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:26	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:28	<br><br>

今年，德国正在庆祝 前东德 和平革命25周年 在1989年，共产主义政权垮台 柏林墙倒塌，以及一年之后 在东边的德意志民主共和国 简称GDR 与在西边的德意志联邦共和国统一 成为今天的德国 在所有事项中 德国继承了前东德的秘密警察 被称为史塔西 （国家安全部） 在它解体后仅两年 它的文档向大众公开 像我这样的历史学家 开始研究这些文档 了解更多关于GDR国家监控 如何运作 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:06	<br><br>
	
可能你看过这部电影 「窃听风暴」 这部电影使史塔西世界闻名 而我们生活在这样一个时代 例如「监控」或「窃听」 这种字眼会在新闻首页 我很乐意分享现实中 史塔西如何运作 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:30	<br><br>
	
首先，我们简短回顾 史塔西的历史 因为了解它的自我观 很重要 它起源于俄罗斯 1917年，俄罗斯共产党人建立了 肃清反革命和消除怠工 紧急委员会 简称契卡 （肃反委员会） 它由费利克斯 捷尔任斯基领导 契卡是共产党人建立政权的一个工具 通过恐吓群众 和处死敌人的方式 后来它演变为著名的KGB （苏联国家安全委员会） 契卡是史塔西工作人员的楷模 他们自称肃反委员会成员 甚至你在这里可以见到 象徽非常相似 事实上，俄罗斯秘密警察 是史塔西的创造者和引导人 当红军在1945年占领前东德后 它马上在前东德扩张 不久，它开始训练德国共产党人 来建立他们自己的秘密警察 顺便一提，我们现在所在的大堂 是1946年GDR统治政党成立的地方 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:52	<br><br>
	
五年之后，史塔西成立 逐渐地，肮脏的压迫工作 交到它手上 例如，关押政治囚犯的 中央监狱 由俄罗斯人建立 被史塔西接替 使用直到共产主义结束 你见到的就是这个监狱 刚开始，每一个重要步骤 都在俄罗斯人在场时发生 但是德国人因高效闻名 所以史塔西成长非常迅速 早在1953年，它比盖世太保 也称纳粹德国的秘密警察 拥有更多雇员 这个数字每十年翻一倍 1989年，多于9万雇员 为史塔西工作 这意味着一位雇员 负责180位居民 这在世界上非常罕见 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:53	<br><br>
	
在这庞大的机构顶端 有一个男人，埃里希 米尔克 他统治国家安全部 超过30年 他是一位及其细心的工作者 在过去，他在离这里不远的地方 杀了两位警察 事实上他定位了史塔西 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:16	<br><br>
	
但是史塔西为什么这么独特？ 首先，它拥有庞大的权力 因为它把不同功能 统一到一个组织 第一点，史塔西 是一个情报机构 它使用所有可想象的工具 来秘密获取情报 例如告密者，窃听电话 从这张图片你可以看得到 还有它不仅活跃在前东德 而是全世界 第二点，史塔西是秘密警察 它可以在大街上拦住路人 并且拘捕他们进自己的监狱 第三点，史塔西 工作像一种公共检查机构 它有官方开展初步调查 和审问人民的权利 最后一点 史塔西有自己的军事力量 超过1万1千名士兵 在所谓警卫团中服役 它被建立来粉碎抗议和暴动 由于这种中央集权 史塔西被称为国家中的国家 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:36	<br><br>
	
但是我们来看更多 史塔西的工具的细节 请记住当时 互联网和智能手机还未被发明 当然，史塔西使用各种 技术工具来调查人民 电话被窃听 包括西部德国总理 和所在部门的电话 每一天，9万封信 被这些机械打开 史塔西也跟踪成千上万的人 使用特殊训练的特工和秘密相机 来记录一个人走的每一步 在这张照片里，你可以看见我 还是一个年轻人的样子 刚好在这个建筑前面 就是现在我们在的地方， 照片是史塔西代理照的 史塔西甚至收集人们的体味 它把样本保存在密封的罐子里 在和平革命后被发现 以上所有任务，由高度专业化部门 负责 窃听电话的任务 和掌管信件任务部门 完全分离 有很好的理由 因为如果一个代理离开史塔西 它的知情度会非常少 如和斯诺登相反 （爱德华 斯诺登，泄露美国棱镜计划） 但是纵向专业化同样很重要 可用于防止产生任何 对于观察对象的同情心 跟踪我的对象 并不知道我是谁 和我为什么被调查 事实上，我从前西德 向前东德走私禁书 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
但是史塔西更典型的是 使用人类智慧 即向史塔西告密的人 在国家安全部 这些所谓非官方雇员 是最重要的工具 从1975年起，接近20万人 和史塔西长期合作 人数多于国家人口的百分之一 在某种情况下，安全部是对的 因为技术工具 只能记录人们的活动 但是特工和间谍同时能报告 人们的计划 和他们的思想 因此，史塔西雇佣了大量告密者 如它所言，获得他们 和教育他们的体系 是非常复杂的 史塔西有自己的大学 离这里不远 他们在那里探索方法、 教导工作者 这本指引给出详细介绍 关于你需要采取的每一步 如果你想说服人类 背叛他们的公民同胞 有时，有人说 告密者是被迫 成为其中一员的 但这在大部分情况下并不真实 因为被强迫的告密者 是糟糕的告密者 只有想给你提供必要信息的人 才是一个有效的告密者 人们和史塔西合作的重要原因是 政治信仰和实际利益 工作人员也尝试在他们和告密者间 建立私人联系 老实说，史塔西的例子显示 要赢得某人背叛其他人 并不太难 甚至某些前东德的高层异议分子 与史塔西有合作 例如伊布拉西 博梅 在1989年，他是和平革命领袖 他几乎成为第一个 自由选举产生的GDR首相 但结果他是一位告密者 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
间谍网络非常广泛 几乎在任何机构 甚至在教堂或者前西德 都有大量间谍的存在 我记得告诉过一个史塔西领导工作者 「如果你向我派一位告密者 我很肯定能认出他」 他的回答是 「我们没有派任何人 我们使用的是那些在你身边的人」 事实上，我的两个最好的朋友 向史塔西举报了我 告密者非常亲近， 并不只发生在我的身上 例如，另一个异议分子领袖， 雷恩斯 菲尔德 在她的案例中， 她丈夫是暗中监视她的人 一位著名作家被他的兄弟背叛 这令我想起乔治 W威尔写的小说「1984」 小说里仅有的明显可以信任的人 是一位告密者 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:53	<br><br>
	
但是为什么史塔西收集所有这些信息 到它的档案室里？ 主要目的是控制社会 几乎每次演说，史塔西部长 会下令弄清楚谁是谁 即每个人在想什么 他不想等到某人 尝试反抗这个政权 他想提前知道 人民的思想和计划 前东德人民当然知道 他们被情报员包围 因为在这个产生怀疑的 集权主义政体 和普遍恐惧感的国家里 情报员是独裁主义里面 压迫人民最重要的工具 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
那就是为什么很多前东德人 尝试与共产主义政权作斗争 如果这样做，史塔西经常使用一种 非常残忍的方法 它被称为分解 它被另一本指引所描述 这个单词很难翻译 因为它原意是「生物降解」 但事实上，这是它很准确的描述 目标是悄悄地毁灭 人民的自信心 例如毁坏他们的威望 通过在他们工作中安排失败 和破坏他们的个人关系的方式 考虑到这一点，前东德是 一个非常前卫的独裁国家 史塔西没有尝试拘捕每一个异议分子 它选择击垮他们 它之所以能够这样做 是因为它有大量个人资料 和大量机构资料 扣押某人 只是最后的手段 为此，史塔西拥有17个扣押监狱 每个地区一个 在这里，史塔西也发明了 很先进的扣押方法 通常，审问人员 并不折磨犯人 反而，他使用一种复杂的 中心是绝对隔离的 心理施压体系 几乎没有囚犯 能够忍耐下来不作供 如果你有机会 请参观在柏林的前史塔西监狱 并且参加由前政治囚犯 导游的游览 这会解释让你知道这一切是 如何运作的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:38	<br><br>
	
还有一个问题需要被解答： 如果史塔西组织得这么好 为什么共产主义政体崩塌了？ 首先，在1989年，前东德领导权 不知道怎么来应对 不断增长的抗议民众 它非常困惑 因为社会主义的发源地 苏维埃联盟 发布了一个更自由的政策 另外，这个政体依赖于 从西部获得的贷款 因此，史塔西没有收到 粉碎暴动的指令 其次，共产主义思想体系 没有批判主义的位置 相反地，领导权坚持了 社会主义是一个完美体系的信仰 当然，史塔西必须证实这个信念 结果是 尽管有所有信息 这个政体仍不能分析自己的真实问题 因而它不能解决它们 最后，史塔西灭亡 因为这些体系 它被用来承担保护职责 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
史塔西的结局 是悲剧的 因为这些工作人员 在和平革命期间 只忙于一件事： 毁灭他们几十年来 产生的所有文件 幸运地 他们被人权活动制止 这就是我们今天能用这些文档 更好了解 一个监控国家如何运作的原因 	<br><br>

Bruno Giussani：谢谢。非常感谢你 所以胡伯图斯，我想问你一些问题 因为我这里有上一周的明镜周刊 「我的邻里，NSA」 （美国国家安全局） 而你刚告诉我们关于我的邻里 来自前东德间谍，和情报员的事情 所以这两个故事有直接联系 还是没有？ 作为一位历史学家当你看到这个 你是如何看待的呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:04	<br><br>
	
Hubertus Knabe：我觉得 应提及多个方面 首先，我觉得 收集这些数据的原因不一样 你做这件事的原因 是保护你的人民 远离恐怖袭击 还是为了压迫你的人民？ 所以那会是一个本质上的区别 但是另一方面 在民主国家中，这些 工具也能被滥用 这也是我们需要 意识到并制止的地方 还有情报机构 也要尊重我们已有的章程 第三点，可能 我们能生活在民主国家真的很幸福 因为你能确定在俄罗斯和中国 他们还在做同样的事 但是没有人提及 因为没有人能够那样做 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:53	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:00	<br><br>
	
BG：当时一个新闻报道首次出现 去年七月 你递交一份德国审理委员会 刑事起诉书 为什么？ HK：是的，我这样做是因为 我提到的第二点 我觉得尤其在民主国家 章程是对每个人而言的 它们为每个人定立，所以它不允许 任何机构不遵守这些章程 在德国刑法里面，它写道 没有法官的准许 不能窃听任何人 幸运地，它记载在 德国刑法里面 所以如果它不被遵守 我觉得展开调查是必要的 而且它需要很长时间 让德国检察官开始调查 并且他只开始于安格拉 默克尔的案件 而不是所有其他生活在德国的人 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:52	<br><br>
	
BG：那没有使我惊讶因为 （掌声） 因为你告诉我们的故事 从外界来看，我住在德国以外的地方 我期望德国马上 给出更强有力的反应 而相反地，这个反应仅出现 当默克尔总理被揭露 在被窃听时。为什么这样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:16	<br><br>
	
HK：我把这件事作为一个好的迹象 因为人民在这个民主国家中感到安全 他们并不害怕会被拘捕 而且如果你在会议后离开这个大堂 没有人会害怕秘密警察 站在外面和拘捕你 所以这是一个好的迹象，我觉得 人民并没有像他们可能那样真的畏惧 但是当然，我认为，相关机构 要负责制止在德国 或者在任何其他地方发生 的不合法行为 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:47	<br><br>
	
BG：问一个私人问题，并且是最后一个 德国内有一个关于 给爱德华 斯诺登提供 政治庇护的争论 你会赞成还是反对呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:57	<br><br>
	
HK：噢，那是一个很难的问题 但如果你问我 而如果我老实回答 我会给他庇护 因为我觉得他做的事情真的很勇敢 而且他毁掉了自己一生 和他的家庭和所有事情 所以我觉得，对于这些人， 我们应该做一些事情 特别如果你看回德国历史 有很多人不得不逃跑 他们在其他国家请求庇护 而他们没有得到 所以给他提供庇护是一个好的迹象 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">How giant websites design for you (and a billion others, too)</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Facebook’s “like” and “share” buttons are seen 22 billion times a day, making them some of the most-viewed design elements ever created. Margaret Gould Stewart, Facebook’s director of product design, outlines three rules for design at such a massive scale―one so big that the tiniest of tweaks can cause global outrage, but also so large that the subtlest of improvements can positively impact the lives of many. 	<br><br>
Margaret Gould Stewart	<br><br>

What do you think of when I say the word "design"? You probably think of things like this, finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand, or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things, classic icons of timeless design. But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design. I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to, designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket. I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend. Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day, that every minute, over 100 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube. That's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined. And Facebook transmitting the photos, messages and stories of over 1.23 billion people. That's almost half of the Internet population, and a sixth of humanity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career, and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges. But what is really hard about designing at scale is this: It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things, audacity and humility ― audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs, and humility to understand that as a designer, it's not about you or your portfolio, it's about the people that you're designing for, and how your work just might help them live better lives. Now, unfortunately, there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101. I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along, and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale, and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:26	<br><br>
	
Now, the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter. Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact. The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook "Like" button decided that it needed to be redesigned. The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized. Now you might think, well, it's a tiny little button, it probably is a pretty straightforward, easy design assignment, but it wasn't. Turns out, there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button. You had to work within specific height and width parameters. You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages, and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers. The truth is, designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
Now, this is the new version of the button, and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over 280 hours redesigning this button over the course of months. Now, why would we spend so much time on something so small? It's because when you're designing at scale, there's no such thing as a small detail. This innocent little button is seen on average 22 billion times a day and on over 7.5 million websites. It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it, but with these kinds of products, you need to get even the tiny things right. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:03	<br><br>
	
Now, the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data. Now, when you're working on products like this, you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions, but it's not just as simple as following the numbers. Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean. Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards, things like spam and abuse. And there were a ton of photos reported, but as it turns out, only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards. Most of them were just your typical party photo. Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example, let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke. This is purely hypothetical, I can assure you. (Laughter) Now, incidentally, you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook? Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook? So anyway, there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse, and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch. He really thought there was something else going on and he was right, because when he looked through a bunch of the cases, he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves. Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before. So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down. But it didn't work. Only 20 percent of people sent the message to their friend. So the team went back at it. They consulted with experts in conflict resolution. They even studied the universal principles of polite language, which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened. And they found something really interesting. They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down. They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:13	<br><br>
	
Here's how the experience works today. So I find this hypothetical photo of myself, and it's not spam, it's not abuse, but I really wish it weren't on the site. So I report it and I say, "I'm in this photo and I don't like it," and then we dig deeper. Why don't you like this photo of yourself? And I select "It's embarrassing." And then I'm encouraged to message my friend, but here's the critical difference. I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel. Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact. Before, only 20 percent of people were sending the message, and now 60 percent were, and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result. That same survey showed that 90 percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you. Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are, but maybe that's where our "Unfriend" feature can come in handy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:19	<br><br>
	
So as you can see, these decisions are highly nuanced. Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions, but we also rely very heavily on iteration, research, testing, intuition, human empathy. It's both art and science. Now, sometimes the designers who work on these products are called "data-driven," which is a term that totally drives us bonkers. The fact is, it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right, but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition. Data can help you make a good design great, but it will never made a bad design good. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change, you need to do it extraordinarily carefully. Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself, and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust. The fact is, people can become very efficient at using bad design, and so even if the change is good for them in the long run, it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens, and this is particularly true with user-generated content platforms, because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership. It is, after all, their content. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:48	<br><br>
	
Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube, we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos, and it was interesting because when we looked into the data, we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating, a handful of people were using the lowest one-star, and virtually no one was using two, three or four stars. So we decided to simplify into an up-down kind of voting binary model. It's going to be much easier for people to engage with. But people were very attached to the five-star rating system. Video creators really loved their ratings. Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design. So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly, we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do, and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation, which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time: "YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization: Its Ratings Are Useless." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
Now, it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use. Even though we tried to do all the right things, we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security, but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff, and it's because these products, this work, really, really matters to them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:22	<br><br>
	
Now, we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details, we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process, and we have to introduce change very, very carefully. Now, these things are all really useful. They're good best practices for designing at scale. But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental. You have to understand who you are designing for. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
Now, when you set a goal to design for the entire human race, and you start to engage in that goal in earnest, at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in. Now, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop. But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity? What if you had no access to public libraries? What if your country had no free press? What would these products start to mean to you? This is what Google, YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world, and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online. Designing for low-end cell phones is not glamorous design work, but if you want to design for the whole world, you have to design for where people are, and not where you are. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:47	<br><br>
	
So how do we keep this big, big picture in mind? We try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear and understand the people we're designing for. We use our products in non-English languages to make sure that they work just as well. And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:06	<br><br>
	
So what does it mean to design at a global scale? It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products. Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting, and the humility part, it's a little tough on the design ego. Because these products are always changing, everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone, and everything that I will design will fade away. But here's what remains: the never-ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big, you can hardly get your head around it, and the promise that it just might change the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:48	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:50	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
Regarding the stat on how many times a day the Facebook "Like" button is seen, I intended to say, "This little button, and the "Share" button that accompanies it, are seen on average 22 billion times a day." 	<br><br>

当我说“设计”这个词的时候 你会想到什么？ 你可能会想到 可以触摸到的精致的物品 也可能是一个商标，海报，或地图 一些能从视觉上解释说明事物的东西 经得起时间考验的图标设计 但今天，我要讲的并不是那样的设计 我想说的是 那种也许你每天都会使用的 但是却又没有关注太多的设计 那些设计一直在改变 并且在我们的生活中无处不在 我要说的设计 是一种数字化的体验 具体来说就是系统设计 它庞大的规模 超乎想象 讲一个谷歌的事实 它每天有超过十亿的搜索量 每一分钟，就有超过长达100个小时的 视频被传到YouTube上 单这一天的量 甚至比美国三大广播网络 在过去五年里加起来的总和还要多 而且脸书（facebook） 也在超过12.3亿人之间 传播照片 消息和事件 这几乎是网络使用者的一半 也是世界人口的六分之一 它们是一些 我在职业生涯中参与设计的产品 它们极大的规模 创造了前所未有的 设计挑战 但是，事实上 关于大规模设计 真正困难的地方在于 它需要把大胆和谦逊 结合在一起 大胆是去相信你所设计的东西 是整个世界所希望和需要的 而谦逊让是去理解， 作为一个设计师 这个设计品不只是关于 你个人或者你的作品集 它在于如何针对性地为用户们设计 以及所设计的产品是否让他们 过上更好的生活 很不幸的是，现在并没有一所学校 开一门“设计以人为本”的课 我和一些同样 设计这类产品的设计师们 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:13	<br><br>
	
在设计的过程中不得不自创了这门课 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:16	<br><br>
	
并且来教授自己 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
要在实践中形成最好的规模设计 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:22	<br><br>
	
今天，我将和大家分享 这么多年期间，我们学到的一些经验 关于设计规模的规则 你首先需要知道的是 点滴的小事影响深远 这里有一个很好的例子可以用来解释 为什么一个非常小的设计会造成很大的影响 脸书的管理团队 成功设计了 脸书上那个写着“赞”的图标 决定要对它进行重新设计 这个按键有些跟不上 我们品牌演变的步伐 它需要变得现代化 可能你会认为，好吧， 那只不过是一个小小的按键 所以它可能只是一个非常简单的 设计任务，但事实并非如此 后来，当我们设计这个按键的时候 存在着各种各样的约束 你必须在一个大量的参数的环境中工作 你必须注意这个按键可以不同语言环境中 都能有效果 同时也要避免花哨或者花哨的界限 因为这个按键要在 旧式浏览器中优雅地渐渐退出 而事实是，即使是设计这么小的按键 也是个是非常痛苦的过程 这是新设计的按键 在过去的几个月里，带领这个项目的设计师估计 花费了超过280个小时 重新设计这个按键 你可能要问，究竟为什么我们要 在这么一样小东西上花费这么长的时间 这是因为当你在做设计的时候 细节上是不存在大小之分的 这个不起眼的小图标 平均每天被浏览220亿次 出现在超过750万的网页上 它是史上最具设计元素的产品 现在你知道为什么 我说在这个小小的按键 设计的背后隐藏着设计者巨大的压力 但是对于这类的产品 即使是小的事情也必须要做好 	<br><br>

另外一件你需要明白的事情就是 如何在设计过程中应用数据 当你在设计一件这样的产品的时候 你有大量关于 人们会怎样使用你的产品的信息 这将会影响你的 设计理念 但是这不仅仅只关系到一堆数字 让我来举一个例子 你就会明白我在说什么了 脸书在很久之前就有一个工具 是用来让人们反馈那些照片 可能会给人们带来不便的照片， 例如就好像垃圾邮件和滥用信息 每天有成千上万的照片被上传 但是事实证明 只有很小的一部分 违反社区标准 大多数是派对的照片 我们来假设一个具体的例子 比如假设我有个好朋友叫劳拉 她上传了一张 我醉酒后在卡拉ok的照片 我向你保证，这真的只是一个假设 （笑声） 顺便说一句 你也知道现在有一些人担心 他们的老板或是员工 看到他们在脸书上的 不雅照片 你知道不让我的朋友看见这些照片有多么困难么 尤其是我还在facebook上班！ 所以，当大量这类照片被当成是 垃圾信息或是信息滥用来处理的时候 团队的一个工程师有了预感 他觉得这当中一定有什么 而且 他是对的 因为当他看到这么多案例以后 他发现大多数的反馈信息 是来自那些照片的当事人 他们要求删除有他们自己的照片 在这之前，我们的团队 从未考虑到这个情况问题 所以他们新加了一个功能 就是允许人们发信息给他们的朋友 让他们把照片删除 但是，这并不起作用 只有百分之二十的人 给他们的朋友发了消息 所以我们的工作人员又回到了这个问题上 他们咨询了专家该如何解决冲突 他们甚至学习了 礼貌用语的通用原则 直到他们做了这项研究以前 我都不知道还有这样原则存在， 我们的工作人员发现了 一件很有趣的事情， 他们不仅仅帮助人们让他们朋友 把照片从网上删除 同时也让他们的朋友了解到 被上传照片的人的心情 如今的设计就是这个经历所带来的 当我看到自己这张假设的照片的时候 它既不是垃圾邮件也不是滥用邮件 但是我真的不希望在网上看到这张照片 所以我反馈了意见，并写道 “我在这张照片里，但是我不喜欢这张照片” 然后我们进一步去探讨 为什么你不喜欢这张有你自己的照片 我选择了：“它让我感到难堪“ 然后我被鼓励去发消息给我的朋友 然而这就是不同的关键 脸书上会给我提供专门的建议用语 用来帮助我和劳拉交流 我对这个照片的想法 我们的工作人员发现， 这个小小的改变 带来了巨大的影响 在这之前，只有20%的人 会发信息给他们的朋友 但是现在有60%的人会去发消息 据调查显示 对话的双方 最后都会觉得不错 据同一调查显示 你90%的朋友希望知道自己是否 做了什么让你不高兴的事情 我不知道另外10%的人的想法 但是也许就是到了我们“解除好友”的按键 非常好用的时候了 正如你所看到的 这些改变是很微妙的 当然，这个过程中我们用了很多数据 来支持我们的决定 同时我们以反复试验， 研究，测试，直觉以及人类的同理心为主 这是艺术和科学的融合 现在有时候，我们也把这些设计者 叫做“数据驱动者” 这完全一个让我们疯狂的词 事实上，我们会因为没有严格测试我们的设计产品 而被认为是不负责任的 尤其是当有那么多的人在 指望着我们做对事情的时候 但是数据分析 绝对不会代替设计的直觉 数据能帮助我们使设计变得更加完美 但是绝对不会把一个不好的设计变成好的 下一个你必须要去理解的事情是 当你想要改变的时候 需要格外仔细 我经常开玩笑说 我在设计产品变动的介绍词 花费了大量的时间 这几乎和我在做产品改动的时间是一样的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
而且我敢肯定 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:21	<br><br>
	
当一件事情需要我们做出很多改变的时候 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:23	<br><br>
	
我们也要对自己做出调整 事实上，人们会因为使用了 不好的设计而变得更有效率 虽然从长远角度上看， 这个改变是对大家有好处的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:33	<br><br>
	
但是有不好的设计产生的时候， 它仍被认为是一个失败的设计 而且这个在 用户创建的内容平台中证实了 因为人们会去维护他们的主人翁意识 毕竟脸书上所说的是他们自己 几年前，当我还在YouTube（视频网站）工作的时候 我们尝试着怎样才能 鼓励更多的人去评价视频 当我们查看数据的时候， 发现了一些很有趣的事情 几乎所有的人都给与了别人 最高的五星的评价 只有极少数的一些人会使用 最少的一星评价 并且几乎没有人会使用 两星，三星或是四星的评价 所以我们决定简化这样的评估模式 我们把它变成只有好和坏两种选择的模式 这对于参与评估的人们来说简单多了 但是，人们非常注重 五星评估系统 上传视频的人也很满意他们的评估等级 成百万的使用者已经习惯了 旧的五星评分方式 所以，为了帮助人们 更快的熟悉和接受这个新的设计 我们把之前的数据图表 放在了网上告诉人们 我们要去改变的原因 没想到在大家的交流过程中 话题被扩大了，于是产生了 我最爱的科技博客（新兴互联网公司评论的博客） 的标题： “YouTube的五星级觉醒： 它的五星评级制毫无用处” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:54	<br><br>
	
虽然不可能完全避免改变带来的反感 尤其是改变了那多人已经熟悉的产品 即使我们试着把所有的事情做对 可是还是受到了如同洪水般的 抗议视频和投诉邮件 甚至我们还收到了一个 需要接受安全扫描的包裹 然而，从另外一个角度来 我们也知道到人们对这个改变非常关注 也是因为这个产品对于他们来说 是真的真的很重要 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:22	<br><br>
	
现在我们知道了 细节的重要性 我们也意识到， 如何在设计中使用数据 而且，在我们给人们介绍产品改变的时候 也要非常小心仔细 这些方法是非常有用的 它们是在设计规模时候最好的练习方法 但是如果你不能懂得其中的最基本道理， 那么它对于你说就什么都不是 你必须明白，你究竟是在为谁设计 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
当你建立的设计目标是 为了全人类而设计的时候 然后你以一个认真的态度去达成那个目标 有些时候你在自己的立场上 迷失方向 现在，就在旧金山， 当我们到达一个没有信号的区域 因为无法使用手机导航来 寻找到新开的流行的咖啡店 我们就开始不开心了 但是如果你因为没有可靠的电源设备 而得开四个小时的车去 找给手机充电的电源设备 如果你不被允许进入公共图书馆了 如果这个国家都没有自由媒体了 如果这些产品对你的要求严格了 这就是为什么谷歌，YouTube 和facebook 被世界所期待 这也是为什么 未来的50亿人 会去上网 设计一个低端的手机 并不是一个吸引人的工作 但是，如果你是为了整个世界在设计 你就必须站在人们的角度上考虑 而不是你自己的角度 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:47	<br><br>
	
所以，我们应该如何记住把这个大的思考立场呢？ 我们尝试站在使用者的角度去思考 我们尝试着去理解他们 我们也邀请那些说不同语言人使用我们的产品 以确保所有的程序都能正常运行 而且我们尝试着时常使用这些手机 以确保我们了解用户的实际使用情况 所以这个对全球范围的设计有什么意义？ 这是一项困难而且出力不讨好的工作 去尝试着改善和发展产品 以谦逊的心态为基本 却又不缺乏大胆创新的心思 去把设计做对做好 是相当辛苦的 而且在设计部分，对设计的自尊心是个考验 因为产品总是在不断的变化 而我在设计生涯中的所有产品都会随着这些 更新换代而消失 而且未来我要做的设计 也会随着时间的流逝而消失 而留下的是 是永无止境的刺激和快感 想到自己是如此巨大创造的一部分 会让我脑子转不过弯来 更何况它包含了 也许能够改变世界的承诺 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:48	<br><br>
	
谢谢 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">The 1s and 0s behind cyber warfare </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Chris Domas is a cybersecurity researcher, operating on what’s become a new front of war, "cyber." In this engaging talk, he shows how researchers use pattern recognition and reverse engineering (and pull a few all-nighters) to understand a chunk of binary code whose purpose and contents they don't know. 	<br><br>

This is a lot of ones and zeros. It's what we call binary information. This is how computers talk. It's how they store information. It's how computers think. It's how computers do everything it is that computers do. I'm a cybersecurity researcher, which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it, to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean. Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here. We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros. We're talking about billions and billions of ones and zeros, more than anyone could possibly comprehend. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:48	<br><br>
	
Now, as exciting as that sounds, when I first started doing cyber ― (Laughter) ― when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, because in my mind, cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer, it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked, and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day, it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen. Those are important things, but that's not how I wanted to spend my life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:18	<br><br>
	
But after 30 minutes of work as a defense contractor, I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off. In fact, in terms of national security, keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list. And the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things. Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives, because computers are an integral part of all of our lives, even if you don't own a computer. Computers control everything in your car, from your GPS to your airbags. They control your phone. They're the reason you can call 911 and get someone on the other line. They control our nation's entire infrastructure. They're the reason you have electricity, heat, clean water, food. Computers control our military equipment, everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks. All of these things are made possible because of computers, and therefore because of cyber, and when something goes wrong, cyber can make all of these things impossible. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:20	<br><br>
	
But that's where I step in. A big part of my job is defending all of these things, keeping them working, but once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things, because cyber isn't just about defense, it's also about offense. We're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons. In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare. Warfare. It's not necessarily a bad thing. On the one hand, it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves, but on the other hand, it means we have a whole new way to attack, a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:58	<br><br>
	
So let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical. Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building, and he wants to do this again and again in the future. So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes. He's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator. Now, it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase, but that's not necessarily true anymore. We're entering an age where we can stop him with the press of a button from 1,000 miles away, because whether he knew it or not, as soon as he decided to use his cell phone, he stepped into the realm of cyber. A well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone, disable the overvoltage protections on his battery, drastically overload the circuit, cause the battery to overheat, and explode. No more phone, no more detonator, maybe no more terrorist, all with the press of a button from a thousand miles away. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:51	<br><br>
	
So how does this work? It all comes back to those ones and zeros. Binary information makes your phone work, and used correctly, it can make your phone explode. So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective, spending your life sifting through binary information starts to seem kind of exciting. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:10	<br><br>
	
But here's the catch: This is hard, really, really hard, and here's why. Think about everything you have on your cell phone. You've got the pictures you've taken. You've got the music you listen to. You've got your contacts list, your email, and probably 500 apps you've never used in your entire life, and behind all of this is the software, the code, that controls your phone, and somewhere, buried inside of that code, is a tiny piece that controls your battery, and that's what I'm really after, but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros, and it's all just mixed together. In cyber, we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles, because everything pretty much looks alike. I'm looking for one key piece, but it just blends in with everything else. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
So let's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist's phone explode, and look at something that actually happened to me. Pretty much no matter what I do, my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information, and I'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific. In this case, I was looking for a very advanced, very high-tech piece of code that I knew I could hack, but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes. Unfortunately for me, I didn't know quite what I was looking for. I didn't know quite what it would look like, which makes finding it really, really hard. When I have to do that, what I have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information, try to decipher each piece, and see if it might be what I'm after. So after a while, I thought I had found the piece I was looking for. I thought maybe this was it. It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell. I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented. So I spent some time trying to put this together, but wasn't having a whole lot of luck, and finally I decided, I'm going to get through this, I'm going to come in on a weekend, and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents. So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning, and about 10 hours in, I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle. I just didn't know how they fit together. I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant. At the 15-hour mark, I started to get a better picture of what was there, but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for. By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together very slowly ― (Laughter) ― and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point, but I wasn't going to give up. After 30 hours in the lab, I figured out exactly what I was looking at, and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for. I spent 30 hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten. (Laughter) I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what I was trying to accomplish. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:56	<br><br>
	
So I was frustrated, I was exhausted. After 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible. But instead of just going home and calling it quits, I took a step back and asked myself, what went wrong here? How could I make such a stupid mistake? I'm really pretty good at this. I do this for a living. So what happened? Well I thought, when you're looking at information at this level, it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing. It's easy to not see the forest through the trees. It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing. But I had this epiphany. We were looking at the data completely incorrectly since day one. This is how computers think, ones and zeros. It's not how people think, but we've been trying to adapt our minds to think more like computers so that we can understand this information. Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem, we should have been making the problem fit our minds, because our brains have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information, just not like this. So what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information? So with these ideas in mind, I sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home, which looked pretty much the same. The main difference is, at work, I'm surrounded by cyber materials, and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation. At home, I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned. So I poured through every book I could find, every idea I'd ever encountered, to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:27	<br><br>
	
The biggest question was, what do we want to translate it to? What do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit? My answer was vision. We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information. We can combine color gradients, depth cues, all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us. That's incredible. So if we could find a way to translate these binary patterns to visual signals, we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff. So I started looking at the binary information, and I asked myself, what do I do when I first encounter something like this? And the very first thing I want to do, the very first question I want to answer, is what is this? I don't care what it does, how it works. All I want to know is, what is this? And the way I can figure that out is by looking at chunks, sequential chunks of binary information, and I look at the relationships between those chunks. When I gather up enough of these sequences, I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be. So let's go back to that blow up the terrorist's phone situation. This is what English text looks like at a binary level. This is what your contacts list would look like if I were examining it. It's really hard to analyze this at this level, but if we take those same binary chunks that I would be trying to find, and instead translate that to a visual representation, translate those relationships, this is what we get. This is what English text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective. All of a sudden, it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros, but show us it in an entirely different way, a way that we can immediately comprehend. We can instantly see all of the patterns here. It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here, but hours, days, to pick them out in ones and zeros. It takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here, but years of experience in cyber to learn what those same patterns represent in ones and zeros. So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list. This is upper case by upper case, upper case by lower case, lower case by upper case. This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns. We can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds, as opposed to weeks, months, at this level. This is what an image looks like from your cell phone. But this is what it looks like in a visual abstraction. This is what your music looks like, but here's its visual abstraction. Most importantly for me, this is what the code on your cell phone looks like. This is what I'm after in the end, but this is its visual abstraction. If I can find this, I can't make the phone explode. I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros, but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:11	<br><br>
	
One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information, stuff that we haven't seen before. So I know what English looks like at a binary level, and I know what its visual abstraction looks like, but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life. It would take me weeks just to figure out what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros, but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions, we can unconsciously apply those in new situations. So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction. Because I know what one language looks like, I can recognize other languages even when I'm not familiar with them. This is what a photograph looks like, but this is what clip art looks like. This is what the code on your phone looks like, but this is what the code on your computer looks like. Our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones and zeros. But we've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach. We've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information. If we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead, we find entirely new ways of making sense of information. In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here. we can see the cross associated with code. We can see cubes associated with text. We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts. Things that would take us weeks, months to find in ones and zeroes, are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction, and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it, what we find is that we're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain's built-in ability to analyze patterns. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:52	<br><br>
	
So this is really nice and helpful, but all this tells me is what I'm looking at. So at this point, based on visual patterns, I can find the code on the phone. But that's not enough to blow up a battery. The next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery, but we're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem. That code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:13	<br><br>
	
So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery, but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that. You have code that controls your screen, that controls your buttons, that controls your microphones, so even if I can't find the code for the battery, I bet I can find one of those things. So the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other. It's really, really hard to do at a binary level, but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead, I don't even have to sift through the raw data. All I have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when I'm at similar pieces. I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what I'm looking for. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:52	<br><br>
	
So at this point in the process, I've located the code responsible for controlling your battery, but that's still not enough to blow up a phone. The last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery. For this, I need to identify very subtle, very detailed relationships within that binary information, another very hard thing to do when looking at ones and zeros. But if we translate that information into a physical representation, we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work. It can find all the detailed patterns, all the important pieces, for us. It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery. All of this can be done in a matter of hours, whereas the same process would have taken months in the past. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:38	<br><br>
	
This is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation. I wanted to find out if this would really work in the work I do every day. So I was playing around with these same concepts with some of the data I've looked at in the past, and yet again, I was trying to find a very detailed, specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information. So I looked at it at this level, thinking I was looking at the right thing, only to see this doesn't have the connectivity I would have expected for the code I was looking for. In fact, I'm not really sure what this is, but when I stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code I saw, this doesn't have similarities like any code that exists out there. I can't even be looking at code. In fact, from this perspective, I could tell, this isn't code. This is an image of some sort. And from here, I can see, it's not just an image, this is a photograph. Now that I know it's a photograph, I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information, so in a matter of seconds, we can take this information, shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at. I saw ― (Laughter) ― it was that darn kitten again. All this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:02	<br><br>
	
So what does this mean? Well, for kittens, it means no more hiding in ones and zeros. For me, it means no more wasted weekends. For cyber, it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems. It means we have a new weapon in the evolving theater of cyber warfare, but for all of us, it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations. When seconds count, we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:33	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:35	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>

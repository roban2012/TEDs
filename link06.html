Shinzo Abe wins again, but what will he do with his mandate?<br><br>

 Dec 20th 2014  TOKYO<br><br>
THE general election on December 14th cost yen63 billion (over $500m), and came just two years after the previous one. So many Japanese could not see the point of it that only 52.7% of voters went to the polls―a post-war low. Yet for Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, the decision to call the election seems vindicated. Even though his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost three seats in the lower house of the Diet, to finish with 291 seats, that is not bad for an incumbent party in the midst of a recession with a leader whose popularity is falling. What is more, the LDP’s junior coalition partner, Komeito, more than made up for the loss by gaining seats. As a result the ruling coalition was returned with 326 out of 475 seats, one more than before dissolution in November. Crucially, it keeps its two-thirds majority, which will allow it to pass laws without the approval of the upper house, should the coalition lose its (slimmer) majority there in upper-house elections in 2016.<br><br>

Mr Abe’s campaign slogan was that “There is no other way to economic recovery” than “Abenomics”, his vaunted programme, high on spin, of aggressive monetary easing to weaken the yen, boost the stockmarket and generate inflation; fiscal spending through huge budget deficits; and―though too little of this has been seen yet―structural change to boost the long-run rate of growth.<br><br>
	
It is the job of the opposition to hold the government’s policies to account and to suggest alternatives, yet the Democratic Party of Japan was in no state to do either. It is a shadow of the force that broke the LDP’s long grip on power in 2009, promising to reshape Japanese politics but in the end governing hopelessly for three years. Though it picked up 11 seats this time, its total haul of 73 seats was miserable. At least its ineffectual leader, Banri Kaieda, lost his seat, giving younger modernisers a shot at rebuilding the broken party. For the time being, says Gerald Curtis of Columbia University, voters returned Mr Abe because they did not want Japan to go back to its recent pattern of revolving-door politics.<br><br>

With a general election now not required for another four years, Mr Abe can claim to have consolidated his position within his party and in the country. He could become one of the longest-serving Japanese prime ministers. Mr Abe claims that he will now redouble his efforts to revive Japan’s economy and make ordinary people feel better off. The economic difficulties in Japan’s regions hung over the campaign. Even though the stockmarket has soared and the property market in Tokyo and other big cities is returning to health, household incomes have failed to keep pace with the early shoots of inflation. Household demand plummeted following a rise in the consumption tax in April, throwing the success of Abenomics into doubt. And Moody’s, a credit-rating agency, has just cut the government’s debt rating by a notch.
<br><br>
Yet perhaps the economy will improve in the coming months. Mr Abe has postponed the next rise in the consumption tax until April 2017. And now labour is tight in various sectors, from construction to exports. With unemployment at just 3.5%, it is reasonable to assume that wages might soon begin to rise. Mr Abe might get lucky.
<br><br>
The question is what he does with his luck. He says he will push on faster with a suite of structural reforms. Speaking before the election, Mr Abe promised progress in agriculture, health care, making the labour market more flexible, and liberalising the electricity market by separating transmission from generation. Notably, he said that a breakthrough with the United States in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade negotiations was imminent. That would send a powerful signal that Japan is serious about reform.<br><br>

Yet for Mr Abe the right-wing nationalist, economics is not his chief passion, and economic strength matters mainly as a means, as he sees it, to restoring national pride and even recasting Japan’s historical narrative. Straight after his election victory the prime minister spoke of the LDP’s most “cherished wish” to rewrite the pacifist post-war constitution, imposed in 1946 by Japan’s American vanquishers. Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds vote from both houses of the Diet, as well as a majority in a national referendum. Mr Abe pledged this week to “deepen national understanding” of the need for Japan to pen its own document, including rewriting the stipulations on pacifism.<br><br>
Such a drive would prove a huge distraction, and would be unlikely to succeed. The newly strengthened Komeito, backed by a large Buddhist organisation, has a strongly pacifist streak. Some of Mr Abe’s allies with even weirder views than his of Japan’s wartime history fared badly in the election. The hard-right Party for Future Generations, led by the 82-year old Shintaro Ishihara, a cantankerous former Tokyo governor, was all but wiped out. Meanwhile the pacifist Japanese Communist Party more than doubled its presence in the Diet, to 21 seats. Despite Mr Abe’s majority in the Diet, this (plus his falling ratings) will constrain his ability to carry out a project that most Japanese do not want. The hope is that he will swiftly grasp this.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the legislative agenda will get back into gear in a special session of the Diet starting soon. Mr Abe’s cabinet will remain unchanged, following a bungled reshuffle in September. The budget for the 2015-16 fiscal year will be the first item on the agenda, including a supplementary spending package to boost the economy and help households suffering from the higher import costs from a weak yen.<br><br>

After the budget, and crucial local elections in April, harder tasks loom. One will be to pass bills to implement a new ruling on collective-self defence to allow Japan to come to the aid of allies, notably America―a change expected to draw heated public opposition. Another controversial decision will be an attempt to restart more of the country’s nuclear-power stations. Two reactors at the Sendai plant in Satsumasendai in Kagoshima prefecture have already got backing from Japan’s nuclear regulator and from the local city assembly to restart. The next ones could be reactors at the Takahama plant in Fukui prefecture. Advisers of Mr Abe say that restarting nuclear plants will not be that great a challenge. But given the low public trust in nuclear power, each operation is likely to prove an energy-sapping battle, requiring local consensus.
<br><br>
Dispiritingly for reformists in the government, Mr Abe made little mention of his reform priorities during the campaign. His supporters argue that both the bureaucracy and many inside the LDP itself bitterly oppose structural reforms. But his victory strengthens his grip on both. He has no excuse not to forge ahead. The next three or four months will be pivotal for Mr Abe―and for Japan.<br><br>

Falling blossom <br><br>

Dec 15th 2014,  The Data Team <br><br>

 
A look at Japan’s economic and demographic difficulties as voters choose "Abenomics"<br><br>
<a href= "pic15.html">Shinzo Abe Elections </a><br><br>
JAPANESE voters renewed the mandate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in legislative elections on December 14th. The vote was seen as a public reaffirmation for the bold economic policies of prime minister Shinzo Abe, called Abenomics. However the country is far from united: the Communist Party more than doubled its seats in the Diet, Japan’s legislature. And amid the general support for Abenomics, the country faces extraordinary economic headwinds. <br><br>

<a href= "pic16.html">Japan: 3rd-largest economy </a><br><br>
Japan is the third-largest economy after America and China. It is so wealthy that its regions boast the same economic heft as large countries. The entire economy of Brazil fits into the Kanto region that includes Tokyo, for example. Yet despite this wealth, Japan’s economic growth has been largely stagnant over a period known as the two “lost decades”. America’s GDP grew threefold during that time while China’s soared. After a short stint as prime minister in 2006-07, Mr Abe returned in 2012 calling for a bold, three-part plan of stimulus spending, monetary easing and structural reforms―the so-called “three arrows” of Abenomics.<br><br>
<a href= "pic17.html">Japan: Finance State Machine</a><br><br>
With the first arrow, the government splashed out 10 trillion yen ($84 billion) to boost the economy. With the second arrow, the Bank of Japan agreed to swell its balance-sheet, which in effect flushed capital into the economy. Japan’s stockmarket cheered the actions. But a previous government had scheduled a consumption-tax rise in April; when Mr Abe went ahead with it, demand fell and GDP atrophied. This prompted Mr Abe to delay the second part of a tax hike, due in 2015, calling into question his commitment to fiscal consolidation.<br><br>


<a href= "pic18.html">Japan: Public Debt </a><br><br>
Decades of almost no growth and heavy government spending to support the economy has left Japan with the highest public debt in the world, at close to two and a half times the size of its economy and more than double that of industrialised countries. It makes the third arrow of structural reform critical, since only by removing anachronistic regulations and freeing companies to compete domestically and internationally can the country enjoy sustainable growth. It was precisely debt concerns that obliged Mr Abe to push ahead with the first consumption-tax hike despite the fact that it conflicts with his economic programme.<br><br>
<a href= "pic19.html">Japan: Population Trends</a><br><br>
A big drag on Japan is its ageing and shrinking population. The country has 127m people and this is forecast to fall to fewer than 100m by midcentury because of the low birth rate. Already there are more elderly than youth, and this will become even more pronounced over the next several decades. It puts a strain on the economy in two ways. First, it means fewer workers to produce growth or pay taxes to fund public services. Second, more elderly means greater public outlays for pensions and healthcare. <br><br>
<a href= "pic20.html">Japan: (DPJ) & LDP </a><br><br>
On December 14th Mr Abe's party, the LDP, maintained its big legislative majority in elections for the country's powerful Lower House. That is a reversal from five years ago, when the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won a landslide victory, ending more than half a century of nearly unbroken LDP rule. But the DPJ's inept economic management, and its amateurism at managing the recovery following the earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, brought many voters back into the arms of the LDP. Abenomics promised a break from the previous, ineffectual LDP economic policies. The question now for Mr Abe, and for Japan, is whether he will use the renewed mandate to shoot the third arrow of structural reforms.

Japan's Troubling State Secrets Law Takes Effect	<br><br>
The state secrets law, passed despite public opposition, provides little oversight or accountability. 	<br><br>
Mina Pollmann	<br><br>
By Mina Pollmann	<br><br>
18-Dec-14	<br><br>
On December 10, Japan’s new state secrets law went into effect, a year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government legislated it into being over strong public opposition. Thousands turned out to protest the bill when it was being negotiated in the Diet, and even now, 80 percent of the Japanese public opposes the law. In the days leading up to its enactment, the Japan Congress of Journalists, Japan Civil Liberties Union, Japan Federation of Commercial Broadcast Workers’ Unions, and several Japanese moviemakers issued statements condemning the law.	<br><br>
The Abe government has pushed forward despite the opposition for a number of reasons. The 2010 leak of video footage showing the clash between Chinese and Japanese ships in the East China Sea may have made the government rethink the importance of protecting information that could be damaging to regional diplomacy. Another important impetus for the new law is the need to share sensitive information with the U.S. and other governments. The U.S. has always been concerned with the laxness surrounding protection of security information in Japan, and heartily welcomed the new law. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy stated last December, “We support the evolution of Japan’s security policies, as they create a new national security strategy, establish a National Security Council, and take steps to protect national security secrets.”	<br><br>
Yet outside the U.S. government’s positive reception, the law is attracting negative international attention. When it was being negotiated in the Diet, Lucy Birmingham, President of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan condemned the bill, stating, “The current text of the bill seems to suggest that freedom of the press is no longer a constitutional right, but merely something for which governments must ‘show sufficient consideration.’” Reporters Without Borders and the UN Human Rights Council have also expressed concern. A clamp down on information is a worrying trend in Japan, as Japan dropped 31 places to rank 53rd out of 179 countries from 2012 to 2013, according to the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.	<br><br>
The law provides for the protection of information in the categories of defense, diplomacy, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage C all important state goals that require a reasonable amount of secrecy. However, its severity, vagueness, and lack of a proper oversight mechanism concern critics who fear that the law will undermine freedom of the press and the Japanese people’s right to know. Abe’s promise that the law is aimed at dealing with “terrorists and spies” and “basically has nothing to do with people at large” may ring hollow in light of revelations about the government’s inept handling of the crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant during the March 11 triple disaster. As Reporters Without Borders put it, “How can the government respond to growing demands for transparency from a public outraged by the consequences of the Fukushima nuclear accident if it enacts a law that gives it a free hand to classify any information considered too sensitive as a state secret?” Masako Mori, the state minister in charge of the bill, has explicitly said the law could be applied to the nuclear power industry because nuclear power plants are potential targets for terror attacks, though he also assured people it would not affect the release of information regarding Fukushima Dai-Ichi.	<br><br>
Under the previous law, the length of imprisonment for most Japanese who leaked state secrets was limited to one year, though defense officials could be imprisoned for five to ten years. Now, government officials and defense industry employees who leak state secrets face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 10 million yen (approximately $100,000). Even journalists and activists who unwittingly solicit information deemed to be state secrets can be prosecuted under this new law, as those who conspire to leak state secrets face up to five years in prison and those who acquire state secrets through illicit means face 10 years.	<br><br>
Even more worryingly, the process of defining state secrets is entirely in the government’s hands. A supervisory committee and panel have been set up to oversee the classification process, yet their independence is questionable as both bodies are composed of government officials. There is no third-party involvement to determine whether the classification is appropriate or not; furthermore, there is no protection for whistle-blowers and no mechanism to punish government officials who classify information as a “state secret” for frivolous or self-serving reasons. Plus, the designation for certain types of state secrets can be extended from 30 to 60 years or even indefinitely based on an internal government decision.	<br><br>
By decreasing transparency in government, the new state secrets law is a fundamental challenge to Japanese democracy. However, the election results of this past Sunday do not bode well for opponents of the law C the largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, was not able to block the Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition from winning a supermajority despite efforts to remind voters about the state secrets law. Without a strong political ally in the Diet C and with most citizens’ attention focused on the very real economic recession rather than nebulous concepts such as press freedom and the right to know C Japan’s activists will have their work cut out for them to repeal or at least amend the law and increase government accountability.	<br><br>

Japan’s State Secret Law Unmolested	<br><br>
Civil society and a fractured opposition are unable to influence the government’s new power.	<br><br>
clint	<br><br>
By Clint Richards	<br><br>
16-Oct-14	<br><br>
The Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided on Tuesday to approve the guidelines for the state secrecy law, which was passed last December. The law, which will take effect on December 10, allows the government to designate information as a state secret under four broad categories: foreign affairs, defense, counter-espionage and counter-terrorism. The law is controversial among Japanese media and civil society, although perhaps not as much as the Cabinet’s decision to reinterpret the Constitution’s stance on collective self-defense. However, it is yet another example of legislation that the ruling LDP has managed to carry through the Diet relatively uncontested, as Japan’s opposition parties remain weak, fractured, and hopelessly outnumbered.	<br><br>
State secrets will be designated by the heads of 19 different agencies and ministries encompassing a wide range of government functions, including the Nuclear Regulation Authority, the Defense Ministry, and the Cabinet Secretariat. Additionally, these government heads will be able to identify state secrets among 55 different categories: from the development of military hardware to information shared through almost any medium by the national and foreign governments, as well as international organizations. The penalty for divulging state secrets will be a 10-year sentence for public officials, and five years for journalists.	<br><br>
Aside from the broad and as yet undefined nature of what will and will not constitute a state secret, the public and the media have raised concerns with the oversight mechanism the government plans to put in place. A Cabinet position at the deputy-director-general level will be created as an “independent archive management official.” The first concern with such an official is that it would be chosen by the very government it is assigned to review. While the official “would check whether the designation of state secrets was being conducted appropriately,” and “have the authority to peruse material to be categorized as state secrets and request it be declassified if it is decided the designation was made inappropriately,” there is no mechanism in place to force ministers to either comply with requests or declassify information. Additionally, although a channel for whistleblowers is expected to be put in place to alert the new inspector to illegal government activity, “whistleblowers will be obliged not to reveal details about the state secrets they are dealing with in reporting suspicious handlings,” according to the Nikkei.	<br><br>
While Abe’s government has said the new law is necessary in order for other countries to feel secure in exchanging classified information with Japan, and indeed the U.S. has encouraged Japan in this legislation, the amount of room available for the government to decide what constitutes a state secret is not well-defined. That ambiguity, combined with oversight officials that lack the ability to enforce even those guidelines that are vaguely laid out, are what has prompted the greatest public concern with the new law. The lack of an effective political opposition since the LDP returned to power in late 2012 has allowed the legislation to remain largely unchanged. However, once passed, any future government can make use of the law, assuming it survives the review process slated for five years after it goes into effect.	<br><br>

Sony’s $60 Million Blunder	<br><br>
Paul J. Saunders 	<br><br>
25-Dec-14	<br><br>

It’s not entirely clear how much Sony Pictures spent to make and market The Interview, though estimates range from $60 million to $90 million. Nor is it clear what damage the film-related hacking scandal will do to the company’s reputation over the long term.  Despite the uncertainty in these two areas, however, it should be obvious that top executives blundered in approving the project in its current form.  If I were a Sony shareholder, I would want a much better explanation than Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has offered so far.	<br><br>
NPR’s Melissa Block deserves praise as one of few journalists to ask Lynton “who thought it was a great idea to make a movie that shows the assassination of a head of state and treats that as comedy.” This should be the central question in this entire ridiculous story.  Lynton’s response―that “we saw this as a comedy” and that “political satire has a long tradition in film”―is weak and superficial.	<br><br>
First, there are important differences between The Interview and other satirical films dredged up in the current discussion.  Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator, parodying Adolf Hitler, did not use Hitler’s name or portray his assassination.  Team America: World Police, which some have mentioned as a recent film that also deals with North Korea, shows the death of Kim Jong-un’s father Kim Jong-Il but only in cartoon form―one step removed from the more realistic live-action killing of his son in The Interview.	<br><br>
More important, however, this is not an artistic or free speech matter―it is about Sony’s wisdom in choosing to support someone else’s free speech.  To be clear, Seth Rogen―who appears to be the creative force behind the film―should have every right to make whatever movies he wants to make.  Neither the United States government nor any foreign government should have the right to apply political censorship to the American movie industry.  That is not the real issue, however; the real issue is who should be willing to pay to produce a film that includes scenes depicting the assassination of an actual living head of state.  How could executives at Sony―a shareholder-owned public company―make a decision like that?  Public companies are not the place to look for political courage; they can’t afford it.	<br><br>
In fact, as Mike Myers’ character Dr. Evil devastatingly reminded in the Saturday Night Live sketch lampooning the affair, film studios regularly cave in to political pressure from every possible domestic constituency (Notably amid this debate over censorship, NBC elected to excise this segment of Myers’ monologue in its online presentation―I watched in on my DVR, but have not yet found the full version online.  It would be interesting to know why NBC edited this out.)  Though Myers did not mention it, studios also routinely modify films to increase their appeal or avoid controversy in major foreign markets, including in the People’s Republic of China.  In other words, major Hollywood studios know that for commercial reasons, they need to be careful about political and other content in their movies.  This is why some films appeal only to smaller privately owned and independent studios.	<br><br>
Indeed, according to press reports, once it became clear that Rogen wanted to kill Kim graphically on screen, top executives at the studio’s Japan-based parent company recognized that their American subsidiary was making a politically problematic film and took unprecedented steps for the company in pushing Rogen to make changes. However, neither they, Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal, nor Lynton appeared to fully appreciate the pressures they would face if Pyongyang threatened retaliation either directly or―as seems to have happened―indirectly with (im)plausible deniability, in this case through hackers that the Obama administration has linked to the North Korean government.	<br><br>
For his part, Rogen acknowledges that he and others discussed changing the name of the leader in The Interview, but states that “And then we thought, like, whose feelings are we trying to spare by doing that ― Kim Jong Un?”  Other sources report that Rogen refused Sony’s Pascal’s request to change the death scene, because “the joke won’t work” if viewers can’t easily see that Kim’s head is exploding, essentially intimidating Pascal with the possibility that “this is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy.” What Rogen appears not to have realized was the danger in Kim’s potential actions, not his feelings―after all, Kim Jong-un has nuclear weapons.	<br><br>
Taking into account everything that has occurred since then, it appears that Pascal and Lynton concluded that the risks of a potentially public dispute with Rogen over the film were greater than the risks from releasing a movie including Kim Jong Il’s on-screen killing―something North Korean officials earlier described as “act of war”―and persuaded parent company executives to tolerate it. And they seem to have done so after Pyongyang threatened that “if the United States administration tacitly approves or supports the release of this film, we will take a decisive and merciless countermeasure.”  Given North Korea’s record, which has included support for terrorism, that is a striking decision for people charged with serving as responsible stewards of others’ money.  Needless to say, their real mistake was getting into a situation in which Rogen could maneuver in this manner in the first place by approving the film without insisting upon a fictitious-but-obvious leader and/or country, a time-honored practice in satire for good reasons.  Media accounts suggest that they feared Rogen would take the film to another studio.	<br><br>
In fairness, before the hacking attack on Sony Pictures, many Hollywood executives probably thought that North Korea was more a punch line than a country (though due to their proximity, executives in Japan knew otherwise).  In this, they were not unlike many members of Congress who fear the domestic political consequences of their actions far more than anything that might happen to the United States as a result of their foreign policy posturing.  After Sony’s public agony, however, more than a few studio heads will likely think twice before doing anything similar in the future.	<br><br>
Indeed, the most serious consequence of The Interview fiasco may well be that by making the flawed decisions they made, Sony executives created a situation in which they could likely not only humiliate themselves by backing away from the film as they did, but damage the entire entertainment industry in the process.  In a business that already spends most of its effort on re-makes and sequels, who doubts that Sony’s mistakes will produce even greater caution, not to mention self-censorship, in the future?  Thus, by attempting to push the limits in the way that he did, Rogen may ultimately have provoked major film studios into establishing tighter restrictions for those who follow him.  That’s the real problem for free speech.	<br><br>

The Sony Pictures Hack and Old Confusion About Terrorism	<br><br>
Paul R. Pillar 	<br><br>
23-Dec-14	<br><br>

The suspected hack by North Korea into the computer system of an American movie company has gotten a lot of people excited without a lot of thinking about the significance, or lack of it, of what has happened and without addressing some longstanding conceptual problems that have plagued discussions related to terrorism. The problems persist even if we simplify matters by accepting the widespread assumption that the North Korean regime did in fact perpetrate the hack―an assumption that, based on public knowledge to date, is not necessarily correct.	<br><br>
It appears that the net effect of the electronic intrusion has been to delay release of a movie―not usually the stuff of which national security crises are made, or should be made. Some of those who are agitated about the incident refer to subsequent bellicose-sounding statements from the North Korean regime that, while denying responsibility for the computer intrusion, refer angrily to the same movie. Some of what that regime is said to have said in the current instance regarding threats against the United States it did not really say. Besides, Pyongyang makes bellicose-sounding statements, including ones specifically directed at the United States, all the time.	<br><br>
Perhaps some of those alarmed about this latest incident believe that the successful hack demonstrates a capability as well as a willingness to inflict more substantial harm on Americans who go to see the movie that the North Korean regime does not want them to see. The imagined scenario might involve something like North Korean hackers taking over the electronics of movie theaters in the United States and somehow manipulating the climate control system to have debilitating or lethal consequences on people in the audience. As ridiculous as such a scenario is, it is not improbable that such images are affecting the thinking of some Americans worrying about what North Korea might do, because this kind of fancifulness has roots in a larger tradition of American thinking about terrorism.	<br><br>
There has been fascination, dating at least back to the 1990s, with possible unconventional methods of terrorist attack, which is to say use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) means or anything having to do with cyber capabilities. And such hypothetical means do indeed make for fascinating scenarios. The sheer sexiness of the subject fires the imagination. That fascination has led to grossly disproportionate attention in commentary and alarmism about terrorism using CBRN and cyber methods―disproportionate when compared to the ways terrorists actually have been harming people.	<br><br>
An example of this misplaced focus and how long it has been around was an article that President Obama's nominee for secretary of defense, Ashton Carter, wrote 16 years ago along with John Deutch, another former deputy secretary of defense, and Philip Zelikow, who supervised writing of the 9/11 commission report. The danger the authors wanted to warn us about was that “terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear devices, germ dispensers, poison gas weapons, and even computer viruses.” All of their imaginative hypothetical examples involved the use of either CBRN or cyber techniques. They argued that the big divide between, on one hand, terrorism we really ought to worry about more and would be “catastrophic,” and on the other hand conventional terrorism which the authors assured us was already getting sufficient attention, was whether or not such unconventional techniques or weapons were used.	<br><br>
The 9/11 attacks, which had nothing whatever to do with either cyber methods or CBRN capabilities, demonstrated how mistaken that analysis was. Nothing terrorists have done in the years since then suggests that the analysis is any less misdirected. And yet, the fascination continues, as do mistaken attributions of newness to threats that fit the fascinating mold. Thus, for example, David Rothkopf tells us this week that “we are at a critical juncture in the dawning days of the cyber era,” that we need “to start writing a new playbook” on foreign policy because of cyber threats, and that in response to the Sony Pictures incident we ought to be talking about using not just cyberattacks but even military action against North Korea. Senator John McCain, not to be outdone by anyone when it comes to talking about getting involved in wars, said the presumed North Korean hack of Sony was “the manifestation of a new form of warfare.”	<br><br>
Another old terrorism-related issue that the Sony matter has raised concerns the official U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. President Obama says he will review whether there is reason to put North Korea back on the list. Such a review would be appropriate insofar as it actually focuses on terrorism. The state sponsor designation has been one of the most abused listings the U.S. government promulgates, with most of the listings and delistings, under several different administrations, having little or nothing to do with terrorism. Cuba's remaining on the list long after ceasing to be involved in anything that could be considered sponsorship of terrorism has been a glaring anomaly, although one that may be corrected in the course of implementing the president's initiative on Cuba. Iraq under Saddam Hussein was moved off and on the list for reasons other than any change in Iraq's terrorism-related behavior; it came off during the Reagan administration as part of the U.S. tilt toward Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, and it was put back on when Saddam invaded Kuwait. North Korea perpetrated very nasty terrorism back in the 1980s but remained on the list for many years after it had stopped doing anything of the sort. When the George W. Bush administration removed it from the list six years ago the real reason had to do not with terrorism but with circumstances associated with the nuclear weapons issue.	<br><br>
Although the fascination with hypothetical cyber shenanigans as a terrorist tool, and the entrenchment of the term cyberterrorism in the language, provide an impetus for labeling the presumed North Korean action against Sony Pictures as terrorism, there surely is a case to be made for maintaining a clear distinction―in terminology as well as in responses―between actions that delay a movie's release and ones that have the more material effects commonly associated with terrorism.	<br><br>
Another reason for pause in applying the label of terrorism to what has occurred, and no doubt a reason the Obama administration is pausing before applying it, is to think about what the United States, or countries the United States calls allies, have done or might do with their own cyber capabilities overseas. If one action is to be called terrorism, then so must the other.	<br><br>
This gets to an asymmetry that has kept us Americans from fully coming to terms with how we and others use state-sanctioned violence for political purposes. The most common conceptions of terrorism mostly correspond to the legal U.S. definition that is used for another one of those official lists (the one for foreign terrorist organizations). That definition refers to politically motivated violence conducted against noncombatants by either a nonstate organization or clandestine agents of a state. Most of the politically motivated violence that we, or our purported allies, practice (much of which affects noncombatants, sometimes in very bloody ways) is conducted openly as military operations. Others may not have that opportunity, either because of weakness in military capabilities or lack of recognition as a state, or both. So we get to apply the label of terrorism to the other guy's politically motivated violence but don't have to apply it to our own, or perhaps to that of a putative ally. A distinction is made in semantics, even if not in morality or material effects. But if we apply the label to any hostile cyber operations in a foreign country and have conducted any such operations ourselves, we lose that convenient terminological asymmetry.	<br><br>
Of course, one could follow McCain's approach of simply calling everything war, but that leads to two other observations. One is that if we have conducted hostile cyber operations not in response to anything that could be called either terrorism or war but instead in response to something else (such as, say, a nuclear program we don't happen to like), then we would have to say we started a war. (And is that any better than initiating other forms of politically motivated violence?) The other observation is that if we are in a state of war any time a hacker goes after a movie he doesn't happen to like and affects its box office receipts, we are in worse trouble than any of us thought.                	<br><br>

The Sony Hack, Edward Snowden and Ordered Liberty	<br><br>
James Jay Carafano 	<br><br>
24-Dec-14	<br><br>
Americans have seen the future, and they don't much like it.  The Sony hack reminds us that everything online is vulnerable. Worse, malicious digital acts can be a bridge to the real world with threats of blackmail, extortion and physical violence. We are not safe in our own cyber homes.	<br><br>
That's not the holiday message Americans wanted to hear. Most are angry and want to strike back.  	<br><br>
The FBI has fingered North Korea as Sony’s cyber bully. Yet some experts still question Pyongyang’s involvement and argue against any U.S. response. Further paralyzing a response is a widespread misperception that North Korea is already the most heavily sanctioned country in the world and, consequently, nothing more can be done.	<br><br>
For example, Katherine Moon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, suggests that, since there "already exists a broad array" of sanctions against Pyongyang, "[t]he most proportionate response that Americans make right now is as consumers―to see the film [The Interview] when it becomes available so that we can support our right to freedom of expression.”	<br><br>
In fact, there is much more that could be done. Over a year ago, my Heritage Foundation colleague Bruce Klingner argued that the pressure being put on North Korea by the White House was tepid and ineffective.  He offered a long list of additional measures that could be taken.	<br><br>
Somewhat incongruously, Moon went on to suggest that, while flocking to see the film in support of freedom of expression, consumers should “also demand that film studios do a public service by reducing gratuitous violence in movies." Admittedly, The Interview is reportedly full of gratuitous violence. But wouldn’t protesting against violence in films impinge on filmmakers’ free speech? It seems in line with CNN's Fareed Zakaria’s blame-the-victim criticism of Sony Pictures for daring to make a film in "bad taste." 	<br><br>
Sony has every right to make another nonsensical, tasteless Seth Rogen movie. We have every right not to watch it. And people who commit real crimes―like hacking and blackmail―ought to be punished. That shouldn’t be so hard to figure out, yet the inability to distinguish between right and wrong has been a hallmark of this debate.	<br><br>
Which is why the Sony SNAFU should bring to mind another heated debate: the furor over Edward Snowden stealing and exposing government secrets. In both cases, the perpetrators stole information and did something illegal with it.	<br><br>
Of course, many of the same people (including probably over half of Hollywood) who are apoplectic over the violation of Sony's intellectual property thought Snowden was a hero on the scale of Robin Hood.	<br><br>
The rules should be applied the same for both Snowden and Sony―the wrong means don't justify any ends.	<br><br>
Both Sony and Snowden offer lessons on the importance of ordered liberty and the need for a free society to balance security needs with the protection of individual liberty.	<br><br>
The Constitution is built on this idea of "ordered liberty,” which seeks to maximize both security and freedom at the same time. The art of governance, then, is to establish rules that let the good guys get the bad guys without infringing on the freedom of the people. The Constitution doesn't give us a rule book to do that. Instead, it sets up security and freedom to fight it out with each other, constantly, like two indefatigable pit bulls. The struggle is intentional, so neither side wins out, but neither gets severely compromised. Freedom and security tear at each other until we get answers that reasonably address both.	<br><br>
This eternal struggle between virtues is played out in the laws that the society agrees upon.	<br><br>
The rule of law is a legal maxim that holds governmental decisions be made by applying just legal principles equally to all Americans in a fair and impartial manner. No one is privileged under the law, nor is anyone singled out for oppression or exploitation. 	<br><br>
This system works great as long as the law is respected and justly enforced.	<br><br>
Snowden trashed the rule of law, and many wrongly cheered him on. Snowden defended his actions by insisting that he was exposing wrongdoing and there was no other way to get the truth out. Both claims have proved demonstrably false. For example, Congress recently released reports on two very disturbing and controversial government activities: U.S. terrorist detention and interrogation operations after 9/11 and the intelligence community’s role in the failed response to the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. Both reports are themselves the subject of some debate, but they demonstrate that the system can look into even the most classified and controversial issues within the construct of the rule of law. Snowden missed the bar of when it is acceptable to take the law into your own hands by a wide mark.	<br><br>
Likewise, ordered liberty and the rule of law ought to serve just fine as guides to lead America through the Sony situation.	<br><br>
First, it’s a free market. Everybody―Sony executives, its stockholders, the film distributors and consumers―can do what they darn well please under the law.	<br><br>
Second, the law ought to be enforced. Americans are entitled to protection under the law--whether our laws are violated by a street thug or another country. It’s shameful that any company ought to fear the U.S. government can't protect them from indiscriminate, vague threats.	<br><br>
Third, while many actors―from the White House to Sony and beyond―have come off looking badly in this sordid episode, it doesn't mean the rules need to be dramatically changed.  This is not a case for "never let a crisis" go to waste.  We don't need new laws giving government more control over the Internet, any more than we would accede to laws giving it more authority over our liberty in physical space after a terrible act of violence.	<br><br>
But we should expect our government to do its job.  The president was right to call for a "proportional" response to North Korea.  It would have been far better if he had dealt more strongly with North Korea before this. Likewise, it would have been better if the White House had dealt seriously with Russia harboring Snowden before the invasion of the Ukraine. But what’s past is past.  What matters now is how the administration responds.  And Bruce Klingner has a long menu of options from which it should choose.	<br><br>

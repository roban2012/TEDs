	<hr><br>
Here's a stat worth knowing: In the UK, 63% of men who finish short-term prison sentences are back inside within a year for another crime. Helping them stay outside involves job training, classes, therapy. And it would pay off handsomely ― but the government can't find the funds. Toby Eccles shares an imaginative idea for how to change that: the Social Impact Bond. It's an unusual bond that helps fund initiatives with a social goal through private money ― with the government paying back the investors (with interest) if the initiatives work. 	<br><br>

I'm here today to talk about social change, not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that, but a new business model for social change, a new way of tackling the problem. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:26	<br><br>
	
In Britain, 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit? Forty-three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison? Seven. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice, and we said to the Ministry of Justice, what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-offend? It's got to be worth something, right? I mean, there's prison costs, there's police costs, there's court costs, all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:13	<br><br>
	
Now, of course, we care about the social value. Social Finance, the organization I helped set up, cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case, because if we could make the economic case, then the value of doing this would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re-offending, then we can do something we think rather interesting. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:41	<br><br>
	
The idea is called the social impact bond. Now, the social impact bond is simply saying, if we can get the government to agree, that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work, which for still quite a lot of bits of government, that's a serious issue. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:05	<br><br>
	
Now, many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point, and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors: there's an interesting idea, right? But actually, there's a lot of people who, if they're given the chance, would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
So we find some investors, and they pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes, and with those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money, and with those savings, they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back, but they make a return. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:15	<br><br>
	
So in March 2010, we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with 3,000 offenders split into three cohorts of 1,000 each. Now, each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes, six months to get through the court system, and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer, as similar as possible, and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction, for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
So everyone wins here, right? The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities: for the first time, they can invest in social change. Also, they make a reasonable return, and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things, they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program, but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years, then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers, well, for the first time, they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years, not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims. Now, the offenders, they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket, half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail, actually, someone meets them in prison, learns about their issues, meets them at the gate, takes them through to somewhere to stay, connects them to benefits, connects them to employment, drug rehabilitation, mental health, whatever's needed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
So let's think of another example: working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at 16, against 58 percent of the wider population. More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly, and this is a Home Office statistic, 70 percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care, and 30 percent of kids going into care are adolescents. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds. That program started last month. Others, around homelessness in London, around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain, and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward, and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:18	<br><br>
	
So what's caused this excitement? Why is this so different for people? Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes, people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example, we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners, and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn, because we pushed for the data, what actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:06	<br><br>
	
And this leads to the third element, which is new, and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things, when you're spending government money, you're spending our money, tax money, and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version 1.0, the business plan, is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this, you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:04	<br><br>
	
The last element is partnership. There is, at the moment, a stale debate going on very often: state's better, public sector's better, private sector's better, social sector's better, for a lot of these programs. Actually, for creating social change, we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
So where does this leave us? This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands, possibly millions of people, who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model, we can help bring them together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:49	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

今天，我想在这里谈论一下社会变革， 这不是关于新的具体对策或干预方式， 也不是关于处理儿童问题的新方法之类的， 而是一种新的社会变革的商业运作模式， 一种解决问题的新方法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:26	<br><br>
	
在英国，63% 经历过短期监禁的人 会在出狱后一年内重犯。 你们觉得， 他们平均每人 会有多少次前科？ 43次。 然后再想想，他们平均坐做过多少次牢？ 7次。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
因此，我们和司法部进行谈判， 我们对他们说， 如果重犯人数减少了， 能给司法部带来多大经济价值？ 多少会有些，对不对？ 这其中有监狱的支出， 有警方和法庭的开销， 还有其他的针对他们善后开支。 这里的经济价值有多少？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:13	<br><br>
	
当然，我们也在乎社会价值。 “社会金融”是我协助建立的一个组织， 专门关注社会问题。 但我们想把这个计划做成经济项目， 因为，如果我们可以做到这一点， 这些计划就会有难以抗拒的吸引力。 如果我们能认同这种价值 并商定一种衡量我们是否 成功降低重犯率的方式， 那么我们就可以实施一些 我们认为有趣的想法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:41	<br><br>
	
这个想法叫做“社会效益债券”。 简而言之，“社会效益债券”是指， 如果我们使得政府相信 我们可以制订一份合同，说明 只有项目取得成效时政府才需要支付费用， 那就意味着，政府可以尝试新的方法 而不必应对 破费却无果的尴尬境地。 这对于许多政府而言 是一个值得深思的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:05	<br><br>
	
现在，大家或许已经注意到 这里有一个问题， 那就是，检验有无取得意想中的成果 需要漫长的过程。 因此，我们需要筹集资金。 我们利用这份合同 从社会效益型投资者处筹集资金。 社会效益型投资者， 这是一个新颖有趣的概念，对不对？ 但事实上，如果有机会的话 很多人 乐意投资 可以产生社会效益的项目。 而这里就提供了这么一个机会。 你是否也想帮助政府挖掘 一个更好地商业运作模式？ 不仅仅是放任犯罪者出狱以后 再次犯罪、再次入狱， 而是要切实地帮助他们 走上一条不同的道路 以此降低犯罪率， 减少受害者。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
因此，我们要召集一些投资者， 他们为一系列的服务提供资金， 如果这些服务取得成功， 达到了改良（社会）的目的， 那政府就因为重犯率下降 而节约了资金， 而这些资金则可用于 支付这些效益的成本。 这样，投资者不仅可以收回本金， 还可以取得收益。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:15	<br><br>
	
在2010年3月，我们签署了 第一份“社会效益债券” （我们）与司法部合作， 在彼得伯勒监狱开展了该项目。 我们把3000名犯罪者 分成3组，每组1000人。 每组的成员 自他们出狱时算起 有两年的评估期。 他们可以有一年的时间再次犯罪， 有6个月的时间走完司法程序， 然后我们会把他们与警方数据库中 基本情况应尽可能相似的 一组犯罪者作比较。 我们得到报酬的条件是 达到重犯率降低10%的预期值， 所有被消灭罪行都将为我们带来收益。 简而言之，犯罪率降低，项目有收益。 如果三组犯罪者 都减少了10%的重犯率， 那投资者就可以得到7.5%的 年投资回报率； 如果项目效益比预期更好， 那他们可以得到13% 的年投资回报率。 这是一件好事。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
大家各取所需，对不对？ 司法部可以尝试一个新的项目， 而且是在有效的情况下才付款。 投资者则有两种好处： 首先，他们可以投资社会变革。 同时他们也能得到合理的收益。 他们也明白， 作为第一批参与这种项目的投资者， 他们必须是社会效益的拥护者， 而且关注社会项目。 如果该计划在5～10年中 都有良好的收益， 那我们就可以扩大投资者的范围， 因为有更多的人对这个产品抱有信心。 这些服务的提供者有史以来 第一次有机会投资公共服务 并以一种积极的方式 来见证他们所从事的事业。 同时，他们可以在5～6年间 学习并展示这项事业的价值，而不是 在常规下短短的1～2年。 社会也是赢家：犯罪率下降，受害者减少。 而犯罪者也可以获益。 从前，他们出狱时 兜里只揣着46英镑， 一半人不知道出狱后的第一个晚上 该在哪里度过。 现在，有人会在犯罪者服刑期间就和他们接触， 了解他们的背景； 出狱时，有人会在监狱门口接应他们， 带他们到住宿的地方， 帮助他们办理社会保险和就业， 联系戒毒中心、心理治疗 以及其他他们需要的东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
我们再来考虑另一个例子： 帮助福利院中的儿童。 社会效益债券取得了很好的成果， 尤其是在那些 花费高昂 却没有成效的领域。 就福利院中的儿童而言 他们的表现十分糟糕。 只有13%的福利院孩子可以在16岁的时候 达到普遍的学业水平， （即完成五门普通中等教育证书考试） 而在全英国的同龄人中，这个比例是58%。 让人忧心的是，监狱中27%的犯罪者 曾经生活在福利院中。 更有甚者， 内政部的数据显示， 70%的妓女 曾经生活于福利院。 （可见）国家并不是一位合适的家长。 不过，现在有很好的项目 服务于很可能要前往福利院的青少年， 而福利院中30%的孩子 是青少年。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
因此我们与艾萨克斯县议会合作开展了一个项目， 来找出全面的家庭治疗方法 以服务于那些可能有孩子要 前往福利院的家庭。 而艾克萨斯县政府只用为 那些削减了开支的项目埋单。 投资者共投入了310万英镑。 这个项目于上个月开始运营。 还有其他一些项目，关注伦敦的流浪人群， 关注全国各地年轻人的 就业和教育 现在，英国有13份社会效益债券。 而社会对其的热情持续高涨， 延展到全世界。 卡梅伦（英国首相）已经为支持此想法 向社会效益基金会支付了两千万英镑。 奥巴马提议，从美国的预算中 抽出3亿美元来推进这些想法 和组织。 还有很多国家 表现出极大地兴趣。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:18	<br><br>
	
是什么让他们如此兴奋？ 这对于人们而言有什么特别的？ 首先，我们已经谈到过了， 是创新。 它给尝试新想法提供了机会， 且这种方式不会给人们制造麻烦。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
第二点是严密。 为了取得效益，人们必须反复试验 并把数据信息应用于正在解决的问题上。 以彼得伯勒（监狱）为例， 我们把个案管理 添加到所有与我们合作的组织之中； 因此他们能够知晓 我们是如何对待不同类型的犯罪者， 同时，我们会主动从司法部 索要信息，因此他们（监狱）和我们 都可以了解到 犯罪者的近况，有没有被再次逮捕。 我们会研究并根据实际情况调整项目。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:06	<br><br>
	
这就带来了第三个，也是一个新的好处， 灵活性。 一般的合同 都是要政府付钱的， 也就是说，要花我们纳税人的钱， 负责项目的人很清楚这一点。 因此，关键是要控制花钱的方式。 在座的每一位企业家都明白， 这是商业计划的1.0版本 而且通常是行不通的。 当你尝试开展这样的计划时， 就需要灵活性来调整这个计划。 再回到彼得伯勒（监狱）的项目， 我们在运营的同时也收集信息； 过一段时间之后， 我们就根据现实与设想的差别来调整计划 并加入了一系列新的元素， 使得这些服务既能 满足长期效益 也能契合短期需求：即 更多的犯罪者 可以参与到期限更长的项目中。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:04	<br><br>
	
最后一种好处是合作。 这其实是老生常谈： 国家变好，公众受惠， 个人获益，社会多赢。 这是类似项目的普遍规律。 事实上，如果想推动社会变革， 我们需要充分利用 社会各界的专业知识 才能使这成为可能。 而这些项目创造了一种机制 来融合各方的力量。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
这一切都说明了什么？ 它们提供了一种方法， 让人们有机会投资社会变革。 我们遇到成千甚至上百万的人 希望有机会投资社会变革。 我们知道很多公共部门中的精英 都很热衷于创造不同。 利用这种商业模式 我们可以把他们团结在一起。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:49	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">What doctors can learn from each other</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Different hospitals produce different results on different procedures. Only, patients don’t know that data, making choosing a surgeon a high-stakes guessing game. Stefan Larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery, for example, to see which techniques are proving the most effective. Could health care get better ― and cheaper ― if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop? 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years, in fact since I became a management consultant. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:29	<br><br>
	
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting, and the second thing, which really bothered me, actually, was that several of the colleagues I met, former friends from medical school, who I knew to be some of the smartest, most motivated, engaged and passionate people I'd ever met, many of them had turned cynical, disengaged, or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries, we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments. After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
At BCG, we looked at this, and we asked ourselves, this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said, "What is it that we are trying to achieve?" Ultimately, in the healthcare system, we're aiming at improving health for the patients, and we need to do so at a limited, or affordable, cost. We call this value-based healthcare. On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG, we decided not to look so much at the costs, but to look at the quality instead, and in the research, one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik, my father-in-law, he suffers from prostate cancer, and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital, he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent, so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20. Either you a flip a coin, or you have a one in 20 risk. That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases, we see these huge differences. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often, the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:26	<br><br>
	
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '70s, there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting, and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that, "My technique is the best," but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that. So they said, "We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best." So they in fact spent two years debating, "So what is quality in hip surgery?" "Oh, we should measure this." "No, we should measure that." And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data. Very quickly, they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in, it actually lasted a lot longer, and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime. They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then, they publish every year. Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom? And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years, Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world, at least for those who actually were measuring, and many were not. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:06	<br><br>
	
Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it. Continuous improvement. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
Now, that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States, the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries, and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now, you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:14	<br><br>
	
We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has, for many diseases, actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year. That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:54	<br><br>
	
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic, and it's all logical, but is it possible? This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare, and I would argue that not only can it be done, but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:15	<br><br>
	
In my practice as a consultant, I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are, like most of you in the audience, very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community, and a large global community, where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions, Michael Porter at Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss, disease by disease, what is really quality, what should we measure, and to make those standards global. They've worked -- four working groups have worked during the past year: cataracts, back pain, coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack, and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples, not only within a country, but between countries. Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16. In three years' time, we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better? Why is that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:59	<br><br>
	
Five months ago, I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed, how do we measure quality today? Can we measure it better than we do? We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements? And we discussed what are the costs for these patients, can we do treatment more efficiently? There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting, the chairman of the department, he stood up. He looked over the group and he said -- first he raised his hand, I forgot that -- he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group, "Thank you. Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:13	<br><br>
	
By measuring value in healthcare, that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients, we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

五年前趁休假的时候， 我回到我曾就读的 医学院。 我穿上白大褂，见了真正的病人， 这是自我17年前 成为管理顾问以来的头一次。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:29	<br><br>
	
我在那里的一个月， 有两件事情让我吃惊。 第一，医学院里 常常讨论的话题是医院的预算 和削减开支。 第二，也是真正让我忧心的 是我遇到的几位同事。 他们是我在医学院的昔日好友， 他们是我所认识的最聪明， 最有积极性的，热衷参与 并富有激情的人。 但是，他们中的很多人，现在变得漠然且愤世嫉俗， 或与医院管理保持距离。 当我们专注于削减开支的时候， 我问我自己，我们是否忘记了病人的存在？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
很多国家，包括你们的， 也包括我的， 都在为医疗保健支出而烦恼。 这项支出占据了国家预算的很大一部分。 而许多医疗体制改革的目标 就是控制这项支出的增加。 在一些国家，看病等待期很长， 特别是需要手术的病人。 还有一些国家，新药没有补助， 于是病人也不能用上新药。 在很多的国家，医生和护士 在一定程度上成为政府削减开支的针对目标。 毕竟，那些花费昂贵的医疗措施 都是由医生和护士来决定的。 是这些人在选择高成本的实验， 也是这些人在选择给孱弱的老人做手术。 所以，（政府想）通过限制医生的自由， 来达到降低开支的目的。 最后导致的结果是医生发现 他们没有充分的自由来 为他们的病人选择最适合他们的治疗方案， 怪不得我过去的同事们 那么沮丧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
在BCG（波士顿咨询公司），我们分析了这个问题， 我们问自己， 这样管理医疗保健的方法肯定是不正确的。 所以我们退一步想 “我们到底想要取得什么成效？” 归根结底，在医疗保健系统里， 我们的目标是要改善病人的身体状况， 而且是要在一定限度内 或者说能负担得起的情况下。 我们称之为“以价值为基础的医疗保健”。 在我身后的屏幕上你们可以看到 我所谓“价值”就是： 对病人有用的结果 除以看病的费用。 这在一本2006年出版的由Michael Porter 和Elizabeth Teisberg合著的书里解释得非常清楚。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
在这张照片里，你们可以看到我的岳父 和他的三个漂亮的女儿。 我们开始在BCG做研究的时候， 我们决定先不看费用是多少， 而是看质量。 在研究中，（医院之间） 悬殊的治疗质量相当引人注目。 比较同一个国家里的不同医院 你会找到一些做的非常好的医院， 但是也有大量医院做的极为糟糕。 这之间的差异非常显著。 我的岳父，Erik， 患有前列腺癌， 很可能需要手术。 他住在欧洲，他可以选择去德国治疗， 那里有声望不错的医疗保健系统。 如果他去了德国的一家普通医院， 他将面临大小便失禁的风险， 差不多有五十百分的几率， 那他将有可能要重新开始穿尿布。 这和掷硬币的几率一样。 50％的风险，不是一般的高。 如果他换而选择去汉堡， 去一个叫“Martini”的医院， 风险几率则减少到5%。 一边是像掷硬币一样的50%的风险， 另一边是仅有的5%。 这是个巨大的差别，有7倍之多。 我们调查过很多医院， 和很多不同的疾病， 我们都发现了这样巨大的差别。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
但是你我不一定都知道，因为我们没有数据。 而通常，这些数据根本不存在。 没人知道。 于是，去医院看病变成了买乐透。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:26	<br><br>
	
但是，其实不一定得这样。我们还是有希望的。 在70年代后期，有这么一群 瑞士外科整形医生， 在年会上， 他们讨论到目前众多的 用于髋关节手术的方法。 在幻灯片的左边，是各种各样的 金属配件和髋关节假体，用于治疗 需要髋关节置换手术的病人。 他们意识到他们每个人的方法都不同。 而且他们都认为“我的方法最好”。 但其实，没人知道哪个办法最好， 他们也承认这一点。 所以他们说，“我们可能需要做质量评估 来得知哪个是最好的方法，并学习它。” 事实上，他们花了两年时间来辩论 该如何评价髋关节手术的质量。 有的说应该评价这个指标，有的说那个。 最终他们达成了共识。 之后，他们便开始（给手术结果）做评估， 也开始共享数据。 很快，他们发现如果 在把金属轴插入大腿骨之前 先打入粘合剂， 这能使手术结果保持更长时间， 而且绝大多数病人 终身不用再做手术。 他们发布了这些数据， 而这一举动改变了整个国家的临床实践。 大家都发现这样做很有意义。 从此以后，他们每年都做数据发布。 每年发布一次积分榜。 谁拔头筹，谁垫底，（一目了然）。 他们还通过访问来相互学习， 进入了一个不断进步的循环。 多年来， 瑞士的髋关节置换手术的 治疗效果问鼎全球， 至少对那些有真正参与评估的医生来说， 不过也有人没有这么做。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:06	<br><br>
	
我发现这一实践非常振奋人心。 即医生们聚到一起， 共同决定什么是高质量， 他们开始量收集并共享数据， 他们发现哪个方法最好，然后加以学习。 不断改进。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
这还不是仅有的振奋人心的地方。 当然这本身已经令人振奋。 但是，如果把”成本“放回到我们的公式里， 然后观察它， 你会发现那些重视质量的（医院） 恰恰在花销上是最少的。 虽然这并不是当初刻意设计的。 如果回头再看髋关节手术的故事， 几年以前，他们做了一个研究 拿美国和瑞士做了比较。 他们调查了在第一次手术后 7年内需要再手术的病人的数量。 在美国，这个数字比瑞士 高出三倍。 太多不必要的手术， 给这些七年内 再次接受手术的病人 带来了太多不必要的痛苦。 现在你可以想象换种方法 能给社会节省多少开支。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:14	<br><br>
	
我们根据OECD数据做了一个研究。 偶尔，OECD（经济合作与发展组织）会根据 他们可以找到的会员国家 的数据来调查医疗护理的质量。 事实上，美国在很多疾病上 的保健质量是低于 OECD平均水平的。 那么，如果美国医疗系统 致力于做更多的质量评价， 并且把质量提高到OECD的平均水平， 可为美国人民缩减 每年五千亿美元的开支。 这占到了美国整个国家 医疗保健预算的20%。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:54	<br><br>
	
你可能会说，这些数字 看上去很美，也符合逻辑， 可这现实吗？ 这将是医疗保健的模式改变， 我认为，这不仅可以做到， 而且必须做到。 而医生和护士将是 医疗系统变革的主力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:15	<br><br>
	
在我做顾问期间， 我每年要接触上百名 医生，护士， 以及医院职工。 他们有着一个共同点， 就是他们真正最关心的是 如何保障病人的医疗质量。 医生和在做的各位一样， 是非常有竞争意识的。 他们一直是班上最优秀的， 我们总是班上最优秀的。 如果有人能告诉他们， 他们的医疗效果 并不比其他医生强， 他们将不惜一切来改善现状。 但是他们很多人不知道。 医生还有一个特点， 他们喜欢得到同行的褒奖。 如果一个心脏科医生向 另一家竞争医院的心脏科医生 咨询为什么他们的 治疗效果更好，他们会分享经验。 他们会交流如何改善治疗效果的经验。 正是通过医疗效果量化和透明化， 我们进入了一个不断改善的正循环， 正如这张幻灯片所示。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
现在，你可能觉得这是个不错的主意， 不过这已经不仅仅是个“主意”了， 它正在发生。 我们正在打造一个全球共同体， 一个很大的全球共同体， 来量化和对比 我们的成效。 BCG与两个学术院校， 哈佛商学院的Michael Porter， 以及瑞典的Karolinka学院， 合作成立了ICHOM（发音“阿嚏”） 你们可能会觉得这听起来 像打喷嚏，其实这是个缩写。 它的意思是“健康结果测评 的国际联盟”。 我们把顶尖的医生和病人 集合起来，针对每一种疾病 讨论是什么决定了医疗质量， 我们应该如何衡量， 最后形成全球统一标准。 在过去一年里，我们有四个小组在工作， 他们的项目是： 白内障，背部疼痛， 冠状动脉疾病，比如心脏病， 和前列腺癌。 这四个小组会在今年十一月 发表研究数据。 这将是我们第一次 在国家之间对比（疾病医疗的效果）， 而不是仅限于单一国家内。 明年我们计划研究8种疾病， 后年，增加到16种。 我们计划用三年时间 完成对40％的疾病的分析。 比较治疗方案之间哪个更好， 为什么更好？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:59	<br><br>
	
五个月前， 我在北欧最大的医学院 组织了一次专题讨论会。 他们换了新的CEO，而她的愿景是： “我希望把管理重点放在 保证病人的治疗质量和效果上。” 在这天的研讨会上，我们跟医护人员 和后勤人员一起 谈到患白血病的孩子。 我们讨论到 我们该如何评价治疗结果？ 我们在评估上能如何改进？ 我们还讨论到，该如治疗这些孩子？ 哪些对他们来说是重要的改善？ 我们还提到费用问题。 我们有更有效的治疗方案吗？ 整个讨论气氛非常热烈。 每个人都热情洋溢，提出了很多想法。 会议结束的时候， 部门主席站了起来， 他注视着大家，然后说， 差点忘了，他先举手了， 他举起手来，攥成拳头， 然后，他对大家说：“谢谢。 谢谢。今天我们终于讨论到了 我们这家医院做的一件正确的事情。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:13	<br><br>
	
（我们所说的）医疗保健的价值， 不只是要考虑费用， 还要为我们的病人带来有效的治疗。 我们要让医院和医保系统的员工 不再是（医疗成本的）负担， 而成为（化解成本的）重要组成部分。 我相信，通过衡量 医疗保健的价值会带来一次革命， 我也相信现代医学的奠基人 一位以病人至上的 古希腊的希波克拉底（希腊的名医，称医药之父） 看到这些，会含笑九泉的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:46	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Is China the new idol for emerging economies?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. Those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world. 	<br><br>

Give me liberty or give me death. 	<br><br>

When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia, said these words in 1775, he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with American generations to come. At the time, these words were earmarked and targeted against the British, but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody what many Westerners believe, that freedom is the most cherished value, and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them? Over the past hundred years, the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years, incomes have increased 30 times, and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions, motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis, President Obama said, "The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched." Thus, there's understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth, liberal democracy, and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:02	<br><br>
	
However, to many who live in the emerging markets, this is an illusion, and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was signed in 1948, was unanimously adopted, what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries, and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today, many people who live in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives, believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point, and what is actually important is delivering on food, shelter, education and healthcare. "Give me liberty or give me death" is all well and good if you can afford it, but if you're living on less than one dollar a day, you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:03	<br><br>
	
Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, "Well actually, this is hard to grasp," because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today, what would you do if you had to choose? What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
Over the last 10 years, I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries, many of them in the emerging markets, in Latin America, Asia, and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents, dissidents, policymakers, lawyers, teachers, doctors and the man on the street, and through these conversations, it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:02	<br><br>
	
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy, nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However, I am saying that on balance, they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from, and how it is their governments can deliver for them, than whether or not the government was elected by democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics, and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:27	<br><br>
	
First of all, it's China's economic performance over the past 30 years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty, specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics, but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China, 28 percent of people had secondary school access. Today, it's closer to 82 percent. So in its totality, economic improvement has been quite significant. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:05	<br><br>
	
Second, China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today, the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems, one with private capitalism, another one broadly with state capitalism. However, these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient, which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times, whereas that of the United States has been declining. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:46	<br><br>
	
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country -- she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States -- but even if you look to places like Africa, China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo, which is 9,000 miles, or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:39	<br><br>
	
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai, you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However, through a network of state-owned enterprises, the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas, using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:10	<br><br>
	
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise that around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying, "I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work." I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular, there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets, when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, not just China, have shown that actually, it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study, the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year, your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year, then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:25	<br><br>
	
What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy, because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies, democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:51	<br><br>
	
The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world's countries today are democratic, 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also, we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:18	<br><br>
	
What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy, is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way, and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world, something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016, that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:51	<br><br>
	
What might that world look like? Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:08	<br><br>
	
The question that is left for us in general is, what then should the West be doing? And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model, and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy, this is basically going against headwinds, but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is, if the West decides to compete, it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate, and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:07	<br><br>
	
Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China, and this is a way, in other words, for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential, they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete, and by that, they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:40	<br><br>
	
The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China, the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior, the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world, perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:43	<br><br>
	
At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is, although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say, "I want that, I like that," there's now a new person in town in the form of a country, China. Today, generations are looking at China and saying, "China can produce infrastructure, China can produce economic growth, and we like that." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:13	<br><br>
	
Because ultimately, the question before us, and the question before seven billion people on the planet is, how can we create prosperity? People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way, to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:36	<br><br>
	
As you leave here today, I would like to leave you with a very personal message, which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals, and this is really about being open-minded, open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world, creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people, has to be based in being open-minded, because these systems have good things and they have bad things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:07	<br><br>
	
Just to illustrate, I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:13	<br><br>
	
Awww. (Laughter) 	<br><br>

I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969. At the time of my birth, blacks were not issued birth certificates, and that law only changed in 1973. This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years, I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein, we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also, it's going to require that we look at our assumptions, assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy, around private capitalism, around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth. Ultimately, it's about transforming the world and making it a better place. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:11	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>

“不自由，毋宁死” 	<br><br>

当弗吉尼亚州州长帕特里克・亨利(Patrick Henry) 在1775 年说出这些话时， 他根本没有想到 这句话会和后代的美国人 产生多少共鸣。 当时，这些词专门 针对英国人， 但过去 200 年来，这句话开始体现出 许多西方人的信仰， 那就是言论自由价值万千， 而且，最好的政治制度与经济体制 一定有自由的元素嵌入其中。 谁能责怪他们呢? 在过去几百年中， 自由民主和私人资本主义的组合 帮助了美国和西方国家 迅速崛起， 将经济发展到新的水平。 过去几百年中， 美国人的收入增加了 30 倍， 有凳f人， 脱离了贫困。 与此同时，美国的独创性和创新精神 帮助推动了产业化 同时也有助发明和创造 家电一类的产品 比如冰箱、 电视、 小汽车，甚至你口袋中的手机。 这一切都毫不令人意外，而后， 即使在私人资本主义危机深重的时候 奥巴马总统都说道： "我们面前的问题不在于市场 是正面还是负面的力量。 市场创造财富，扩展自由 的力量是无与伦比的。 因此，人们可以理解 这个在西方人脑海中根深蒂固的观念， 全世界都会采取 私人资本主义作为经济增长的模式， 采纳自由民主，并将持续 优先选择获得政治权利而非经济利益。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:02	<br><br>
	
但是，对很多生活在新兴市场国家的人来说， 这是一种空想，即使 1948年签署的 《世界人权宣言》 获得了一致通过， 它所做的也是掩盖 发达国家和发展中国家之间出现的分裂， 以及政治权利和经济利益间 不同意识形态的分裂。 这个分裂不断扩大。 今天，很多人生活在新兴国家， 占世界人口的90%， 他们不相信西方对政治权利的执着 有那么重要， 真正重要的是 政府提供食物、 住所、 教育和医疗保健。 "不自由，毋宁死" 确实理想，但要在能负担的前提下才成立， 但如果你每天靠不到 1 美元收入过活， 你只会挣扎求生存 和供养家人 而不会花时间到处去 宣扬和捍卫民主。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:03	<br><br>
	
现在，我知道在座的很多人 以及世界各地的许多人会认为， "事实上，这很难让人接受，" 因为私人资本主义和自由民主 是神圣不可侵犯的。 但我现在问你，如果要你选择 你会怎么做？ 如果你必须在 有地方住 和投票的权之间做出选择，你会怎么选？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
过去 10 年中， 我曾有幸到 60 多个国家旅行， 许多是新兴国家， 在拉丁美洲、 亚洲、 和我家乡非洲大陆的一些国家。 我见过总统、异议人士、 政策制定者、 律师、 教师、 医生和路人， 并通过和他们的谈话， 清楚了解到 很多新兴国家的人们 相信确有正在形成的分裂， 西方人相信的 政治经济意识形态 和世界其他地区人们相信的不一样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:02	<br><br>
	
现在，不要误解我的意思。 我不是说在新兴市场中的人们 不懂民主， 我也不是说在理想的情况下 他们不愿意自由选择自己的总统或领导人。 他们当然愿意。 然而若考虑各种条件， 他们会更关心 如何改善生活水平， 以及政府如何提供途径， 而不是政府 是否由民主选举产生。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
事实上， 这已经成为一个非常沈痛的问题 因为这是在很长时间内第一次 对西方政治和经济意识形态系统 的真正挑战， 这是以中国为代表的系统， 不是私人资本主义，而是国家资本主义。 他们不主张自由民主，并推后实行民主制度。 他们亦决定优先考虑 经济利益而不是政治权利。 我今天为你们介绍的这个 以中国为代表的系统， 得到新兴国家人民的广泛拥护 并被当成体系来遵循， 因为人们越来越相信 是这一体系 保证在最短时间内最好最快地改进 人们的生活标准。 如果大家允许的话，我会花几分钟 先向大家解释 为什么在经济上他们有这信念。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:27	<br><br>
	
首要因素是中国在过去三十年 的经济表现。 中国已经能够产生创纪录的经济增长 并卓有成效地使许多人摆脱了贫困， 特别在消除贫困方面打开了缺口 使得超过 3 亿人 脱离了贫穷。 变化不仅发生在经济上， 同时也发生在生活水平的变化上。 我们看到，过去在中国，只有28%的人口 接受中学教育。 今天，这一数字接近于 82%。 所以总体上经济改善的成果 已经相当明显。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:05	<br><br>
	
其次，中国已能 在不改变政治结构的前提下 卓有成效地改善收入不平等的问题。 今天，美国和中国 是世界上两个主要的经济体。 他们有着极其不同的政治制度 和经济制度， 一个奉行私人资本主义 另一个广泛地践行着国家资本主义。 然而，这两个国家 有相同的基尼系数， 基尼系数反应收入平等的状况。 也许令人感到更加不安的是 中国的收入平等状况 最近以来一直在改善， 而美国的情况 却一直在恶化。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:46	<br><br>
	
再次，新兴国家的人们 惊讶于中国如神话传说般的 基础设施建设。 这不单指中国 在自己国家建设的 道路、港口、铁路―― 中国已经建造了 85,000 公里长的 国内公路网 并超越了美国建造的总长度 但就算看看像非洲这样的地方， 中国已经帮助非洲铺设了从开普敦到开罗 那么长距离的沥青路， 长度是 9000 英里， 或者说是从纽约到加利福尼亚州距离的三倍。 这是人们看得到摸得着的事物。 也许这并不令人意外 在 2007 年的皮尤调查中， 来自10 个非洲国家的受访者说： 他们认为，中国建设者们做了 一些令人称奇的事来提高非洲人的生活水平 提升幅度之大，达到 98%之高。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:39	<br><br>
	
最后，中国还提供创新方案 来解决世界面临的根深蒂固的社会问题。 如果你到摩加迪沙(索马里首都)、 墨西哥城或孟买旅行 你会发现那些破旧不堪的基础设施和物流 仍是发展偏远地区 卫生保健的 一个绊脚石。 然而，通过国营企业通力合作 并藉国籍企业之便， 中国已经能够走进这些农村地区， 协助解决当地的医药卫生问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:10	<br><br>
	
女士们先生们，这并不令人意外 在全世界各地，人们都在谈论中国的所作所为， "我喜欢那样的。我想要那样的。 我想做中国做的事情。 中国的体制看来是行得通的&quot;。 说到这，我还要告诉你们， 随着中国目前的发展， 对民主的观点 也产生了许多变化。 尤其是，在新兴市场国家 有越来越多人的怀疑， 这是因为目前，民主制度 不再被视为 经济发展的先决条件。 事实上，不只是中国，像台湾、 新加坡、 智利等 实际上都证实了这点， 经济增长，是民主的 一个先决条件。 在最近的研究中，有迹象显示 收入是决定民主持续时间的 最大因素。 研究发现，如果一国的人均收入 是大约 1000 美元一年， 其民主政体将持续约八年半。 如果一国人均收入在 每年2000 至 4000 美元 可能会有33 年的民主。 只有人均收入 达到每年 6000 美元以上 民主才会持续。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:25	<br><br>
	
这告诉我们 首先需要建立一个 能问责政府的中产阶级。 但也许这还告诉我们 我们应该为在世界各地 将民主强加于人感到不安 因为最终我们要承担的风险 就是狭隘的民主， 某种程度来说，这样的民主， 可能比设法终结的独裁政府 还要糟糕! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:51	<br><br>
	
狭隘民主的证据 是十分让人沮丧的。 自由之家（Freedom House）认为，虽然今天 世界上 50%的国家是民主国家， 但这些国家中的 70%是狭隘的 就人民没有 言论或行动自由而言。 但同时，我们从自由之家 去年出版的一项研究中发现 过去七年的每一年里 自由的发展都在恶化。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:18	<br><br>
	
这表示： 对于像我这样的人 在乎自由民主的人， 需要找到更多可持续的方式 确保有一个可持续的 实现民主的方式， 并且拥有深厚的经济基础。 但同时，当中国就要 成为世界最大经济体时， 专家预计2016 年 这便会成真， 在西方和世界其他地区之间的 政治和经济意识形态的分裂 很可能会扩大。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:51	<br><br>
	
这个世界可能变成什么样？ 嗯，世界可能会有 更多的国家干预和国家资本主义； 及民族国家更强烈的保护主义； 但我刚才也提过的， 不断减少的政治权利 和个人权利。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:08	<br><br>
	
因此我们共同的问题是， 在这之后，西方应该怎样做？ 我认为，西方有两个选项。 他们可以或竞争或合作。 如果西方选择与中国模式竞争， 实质上就是要在全世界 继续尝试和推行 私人资本主义和自由民主， 这基本上都是在逆风而行， 但这对西方来说 也是理所当然的立场 因为在很多方面 西方模式与中国模式的 暂缓民主和国家资本主义是对立的。 事实是， 如果西方决定要竞争， 将产生更大的分裂。 西方的另一个选项是进行合作， 我的意思是通过合作， 给予新兴市场国家一些弹性空间， 让他们顺其自然地找出 什么样的政治和经济制度 对他们来说才是最佳的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:07	<br><br>
	
我确信在座的有一些人 正在想，咳，这不就是对中国让步， 换句话说，这种方式 就是让西方处于次要地位。 但我告诉你们 如果美国和欧洲国家 想要在全球保持影响力 他们可能会为了竞争， 短期内不得不考虑合作 以此类推，他们可能不得不更积极地 关注经济成果 来帮助创建中产阶层 让政府负起责任 并创建我们真正想要的民主政体。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:40	<br><br>
	
事实就是， 与其在国际上 鼓吹与中国交流， 西方应该鼓励自己的企业 在这些地区进行贸易和投资， 与其批评中国的不良行为。 西方应该展示 为何他们自己的政治和经济制度 是有优势的。 与其在世界各地 强行推进民主， 或许西方应从借镜 自己的历史经验 并且铭记：你们今天 拥有的模式与体系得以发展 至此 也是慢慢累积的。 的确，最高法院法官斯蒂芬 ・ 布雷耶(Stephen Breyer.) 提醒我们 从制定宪法 直到达到权利平等 花费了170年。 如今有些人会争论说 权利不平等仍然存在的。 事实上，仍然有群体会争辩 他们在现有的法律之下没有得到平等权利。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:43	<br><br>
	
西方模式最棒的地方是， 直截了当地证明了。 它是让下一餐有着落的模式。 让人有冰箱。 还把人送上了月球。 但事实是， 虽然人们过去 经常指着西方国家并且说： "我想要那样的，我喜欢那样的，" 但现在出现了一个新人， 也就是中国。 今天，几代人正看着中国 并说：&quot;中国可以建设基础设施， 中国可以创造经济增长， 我们喜欢那样的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:13	<br><br>
	
因为，最终摆在我们面前的问题 和地球上 70 亿人 面前的问题都是： 我们如何创造繁荣？ 在乎这点的人 会理性地 以中国的政经模式为基础 倾向于那些可以确保 他们能够在最短时间内 拥有更高生活水准的模式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:36	<br><br>
	
在你们今天要离开的时候， 我想要留给你们 一点个人的见解， 也就是我相信 我们应当作为独立的个人来做事， 也就是要变得思想开明， 对于我们想要为全世界的人们 创造繁荣， 并且有意义地为数以亿计的人们 削弱贫困的希望与梦想。 都要从开放的态度做起， 因为不同的体系有优点 也有缺点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:07	<br><br>
	
为了f明这一点， 我调查了关于我自己的记录。 这是我的照片。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:13	<br><br>
	
噢。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:15	<br><br>
	
我在1969年出生于赞比亚。 在我诞生时， 黑人得不到出生证明， 那条法律在1973年才改变。 这是赞比亚政府的誓章。 我展示这些，是为了告诉你们 这四十年来，我从不被承认 到今天站在TED观众前 为你们讲述我的观点的经历。 从这一点上讲，我们可以促进经济增长。 我们可以卓有成效地削弱贫困。 不仅如此，这也将要求我们 正视我们的观念， 我们从小到大关于 民主与私人资本主义， 关于什么才能促进经济增长 并且减少贫困、创造自由的观念与教条。 我们也许不得不撕掉那些书本 来开始正视其它选项 并且积极地探求真实。 最终，我们要改变世界 并使它成为一个更好的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:11	<br><br>
	
非常感谢你们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:13	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">How the NSA betrayed the world's trust</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity ― whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. An important rant, wrapped with a plea: to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world's information needs. 	<br><br>

 How the NSA betrayed the world's trust ― time to act  	<br><br>
  Nov 2013 	<br><br>
	
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. They've changed the world. However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:01	<br><br>
	
We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6. Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:31	<br><br>
	
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. (Laughter) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:55	<br><br>
	
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big? Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store? Right? It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:17	<br><br>
	
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:46	<br><br>
	
Right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:57	<br><br>
	
But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:45	<br><br>
	
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:38	<br><br>
	
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:20	<br><br>
	
So what do we actually know about the leaks? Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:03	<br><br>
	
And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation? And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating. Instead, they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual. Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this. What the hell? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:30	<br><br>
	
And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example. Let's take, for example, Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means, not even close. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:43	<br><br>
	
And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. Like, Skype used to be secure. It used to be end-to-end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today, it no longer is secure. So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:11	<br><br>
	
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well, it's not the war on terror. Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right? It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom? Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:33	<br><br>
	
But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:53	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:59	<br><br>
	
Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:30	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:37	<br><br>
	
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:09	<br><br>
	
And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, "If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:43	<br><br>
	
That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:14	<br><br>
	
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:32	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:35	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:42	<br><br>
	
So, what is there to be done? Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that? A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:18	<br><br>
	
But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:08	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:10	<br><br>

互联网和手机可以说是 我们这个时代 最为重要的两大发明了 它们改变了整个世界 然而，令我们非常吃惊的是 它们同时也成为了 用于国家监视的完美工具 事实上，收集关于我们 每个人或者说所有人的 数据、信息以及关系的这种能力 正是这个夏天从 西方情报机构 特别是美国情报机构 所透露或者泄露的 这些情报机构监视着世界其它地方 六月六日开始 陆续听到一些泄露的消息 斯诺登开始透露 那些来源于美国情报机构的 顶级机密信息 于是我们也开始了解到一些 诸如菱镜计划和XKeyscore的事情 这些都是美国情报机构 正在运作的项目 以此对抗世界其它国家 如果你回顾一下乔治・奥威尔 有关监视的预言 你会发现 奥威尔的确是一个乐观主义者 (笑声) 如今我们看到的是大规模的 对普通民众的跟踪 这远远超出了他最初的想象 这就是那个臭名昭著的 美国犹他州的NSA数据中心 在不久的将来开放后 它将成为一个超级计算中心 同时也将成为一个超大数据中心 你几乎可以想象那个被硬盘设备塞满的大厅 无时不刻都在存储 他们收集来的数据 这是一幢巨大的建筑 具体有多大呢？我们来看一个数据 14万平方米 可能你对这个数据也没有太多概念 我们最好通过比较来想象 想想你去过的 最大的宜家家具吧 它将是宜家的五倍大 想想你能在宜家塞进多少硬盘设备吧 是吧？数目的确非常巨大！ 我们估算仅用于运行 这个数据中心的电费 每年就需要数千万美元 而这种大规模的监视 意味着他们可以收集我们的数据 并且基本上可以永久保留 保留很长时间 几年甚至几十年 这个将给我们所有人 带来前所未有的风险 它将是一种大规模的对我们每个人的 无障碍监视 当然，确切来说也不是对所有人 因为美国情报机构只有对外国人的 合法监视权力 一旦那些非美国的数据流 到达或者经过美国 就要被监视了 监视外国人听起来似乎没那么糟糕 除非你意识到 其实我们都是老外 事实上，这个星球上96%都是老外 (笑) 是吧？ 所以说只要你使用通信工具和互联网 你就会被彻底监视 大家也别误会 的确也有一些还不错的监视形式 我热爱自由，但我自始至终也同意 有一些监视是有益的 比如如果执法机关正在寻找一名谋杀犯 或者搜捕一个贩毒者 或者试图阻止一场校园枪击案的发生 并且他们中有头目有嫌疑犯 此时如果能监听他们的手机 截获他们的网络通信那就太棒了 我并不反对这一点 但菱镜计划之类的项目并不是这么做的 他们不是在监视那些 他们有理由怀疑的坏人 他们在监视那些 无辜的人 对于这样的监听 有四条主要的理由 首先是只要你 一开始讨论信息泄露的问题 总会有反对者站出来 把泄露的重要性降到最小 他们说我们早已知道这些 我们知道在发生什么，没有什么新鲜的 事实不是这样的 谁说我们早知道这些？我们不知道 我们最大的恐惧就是这些事情已经发生 而我们一无所知 现在我们的确可以确定的知道在发生什么 而我们之前并不了解 我们不了解PRISM 也不了解XKeyscore，Cybertrans 还有DoubleArrow 以及Skywriter 这些各式各样 由美国情报局运行的项目 但现在我们都了解了 我们之前也并不知道 美国情报机构如何极端到 通过渗透至标准组织内部 以达到削弱加密算法强度的目的 这就意味着 如果你拿到一份加密文件 它的加密算法可以安全到 使你加密之后 没有任何人可以解开它 即便你用地球上的每一个计算机去解密它 也需要数百万年 它可以说是绝密的，无懈可击 拿到这样一件完美的东西 然后故意弱化它 使得我们每个人终都变得不安全 现实生活中一个类似的例子是 情报机构会强行 将某种加密识别码植入每个家居防盗系统 这样他们就可以进入任何一所房子 因为坏人可能装有防盗系统 但这样一来 最后我们自己也变得不那么安全 利用加密算法这个后门儿 的确让人匪夷所思 当然啦，这些情报机构只是在履行自己的职责 这正是他们被要求做的事情 做信号情报 监视通讯渠道 以及监测网络流量 这正是他们尝试在做的 由于目前相当大一部分的互联网流量是加密的 他们也就在尝试通过加密寻找突破口 削弱加密算法就是其中一种手段 这是美国情报机构如何 为所欲为 的一个极好的例子 他们完全不受控制 而这些应该加以控制 而我们对这些信息泄露的真实了解能有多少呢 所有这些都基于 Snowden先生的那些泄露文件 从六月初 第一个PRISM的幻灯片开始 它详细描述了 一个从服务提供商收集数据的项目 而且他们还对那些被使用的 服务商进行了命名 甚至为他们设立一个纪念日 记载开始从各个服务提供商 获取数据的日子 比如，他们为2007年9月11号 开始从Microsoft获取的那批数据起了名字 还有2008年3月12号的Yahoo 之后还有Google, Facebook Skype, Apple等等 任何一个公司对此都呈否认态度 都说这简直就是谎言 他们从来没有开过后门让别人获取他们的数据 但是我们的确得到了这些文件 那么是其中一方在撒谎吗？ 有没有其他可能的解释？ 一种可能的解释是 这些当事人，也就是这些服务提供商 他们并没有合作 只是被黑了 这种解释是合理的：他们没有参与而是受到了黑客攻击 其实可以说是他们被自己的政府黑了 也许这听起来有点荒唐 但我们的确有过这样的案例 比如那个有关恶意软件Flame的案子 我们之前多么坚信它是由 美国政府授权的 而就是它破坏了Windows的 网络升级系统的安全 这就意味着 他们被自己的政府黑了 当然还有更多 支撑这个说法的证据 德国的明镜周刊（Der Spiegel）暴露了更多 有关这些情报机构中的顶级黑客团队 所做作为的信息 在NSA内部, 这个部门被叫做TAO 特定情报获取行动 这个等同于英国GCHQ内部的NAC 网络分析中心（Network Analysis Centre） 最近泄露的这三个幻灯片 详细描述了一个由GCHQ情报局 在英国发起的行动 目标定位在 一个比利时的电信公司 这件事表明了一个事实 一个欧盟国家的情报机构 正在蓄意破坏 联盟国家电信公司的安全 而他们在幻灯片里谈论这件事时 一如既往的自然 这是主要目标 这是次要目标 这是他们的团队 他们通常会在周四晚上在酒吧里做团队建设的活动 他们每成功一次 就会用一些俗气的幻灯片 庆祝所谓的胜利 他们究竟在搞什么鬼 有人会争辩说 是的，他们是在监视 但话说回来，哪个国家没有这样的行动呢？ 也许真的是 所有国家都有间谍 很多国家都有，但并不是所有都是这样 比如说，瑞典 我提起瑞典这个国家是因为 在法律方面它与美国是有些相似的 当你的数据流经过瑞典的时候 他们的情报机构的确是有 截获这些数据的合法权力 那么，有多少瑞典的决策者 政治家和商业领袖 每天使用美国的服务呢？ 比如像使用Windows或OSX 使用Facebook或LinkedIn 或者将数据上传到类似iCloud中进行云存储 还有Skydrive或者DropBox 也许还有一些在线服务，类似Amazon网络服务或者销售支持？ 答案是，每一个瑞典的商业人士每天都会使用它们 那么如果我们反过来问 有多少美国杰出人士 使用瑞典的网络邮箱和云服务呢？ 答案是零 所以这显然是不平衡的 相差甚远 即使有一天我们偶然发现一个 欧洲人获胜的故事 典型的结局一定是这个服务被美国公司收购 比如，Skype最初采用端到端的加密 所以还是安全的 后来被卖给了美国后 就不再安全了 所以，我们再一次把一个原本安全的东西 弄得不再安全 使得我们所有人最终也都不再安全了 也有争论说 美国只是在 展开一场针对恐怖分子的战争 本来无需担忧 但事实上它不是 是的，我们承认这中间有恐怖分子 我们必须与这些 肆意残害的行为作战 但从那些泄露的消息中我们也知道 他们在使用相同的手段 监听那些欧洲的领导者 截获墨西哥和巴西居民的邮件 甚至联合国总部以及欧盟议会的邮件 他们显然不会在欧盟议会内部 寻找恐怖分子，对吧？ 所以，这不是一场针对恐怖分子的战争 虽然部分意义上可以说是 恐怖主义的确是存在的 但我们会认为它是一种 必需我们不惜一切代价去全力对抗的现存威胁么？ 美国人民准备为了恐怖分子 而抛弃宪法？ 抛弃那些人权法案？ 还有世界人权宣言 欧盟那些关于人权和基本自由的法案 还有出版自由？ 我们真的认为恐怖主义 需要我们不惜这一切代价吗？ 是的，人们惧怕恐怖主义 所以也许他们认为这样的监视是合理的 反正也没什么需要隐藏的 需要的话那就随便监视好了 但是，谁说他们没有什么值得隐藏起来的？ 只是他们还没有考虑那么长远罢了 (掌声) 因为我们每个人都有隐私 如果你真的认为你没有什么要隐藏的 那你一定要弄清楚这是你告诉我的第一件事 因为这之后我会觉得 不能再信任你 因为你明显不会保守秘密 人们对互联网都表现出盲目的诚实 当那些信息开始泄露的时候 许多人问我 说他们没有什么需要隐瞒的 也没有做什么坏事或者违法的事情 而且我也没有什么想要与 情报中心分享的特殊信息 何况还是国外的情报机构 就算我们真的需要一个老大 我也希望他是本国的 而不是来自国外 当信息泄露开始的时候，我最先发表的 一条评论就是关于 当人们使用搜索引擎时， 是如何将信息泄露给了美国情报机构 两分钟后我收到一条回复 来自一个叫做Kimberly的美国人 他反对我说 我又没有发送裸照之类的东西，为什么我还需要担心这个？ 我回答他说 我发送什么与你无关 当然也与你的政府无关 因为这就是隐私 这一点没什么好讨论的 就是应该在我们所用的所有系统得到保障 (鼓掌) 有一点我们需要知道的是 我们对搜索引擎也是在盲目信任 只要你透露了你的搜索记录 我就能在五分钟之内 找到那些与之关联的让人尴尬的东西 我们对搜索引擎的诚实 常常多于对我们的家庭 搜索引擎通常也比你的家人 更了解你 这就是那些我们 泄露给美国的信息 监视改变历史 堕落总统Nixon之类的例子告诉我们这些 想象下如果他当时有现在这样的情报收集工具会怎么样吧 我想用巴西总统Dilma Rousseff夫人 做个例子 她就是NSA监视的对象之一 她的邮件被截获了 她曾经在联合国总部质问 “如果没有隐私的权利 就不会有什么真正的言论自由和舆论自由 因此也不可能有有效的民主” 就是这样 隐私是民主的基础 一名在安全方面的同行学者Marcus Ranum曾说 如今美国对互联网的态度 就像对待他们的殖民地 所以我们已经又回到了殖民时代 我们这些互联网的外国用户 应该把美国当做自己的主人 Snowden先生曾经受到过种种指责 有些人谴责他带来了美国云产业 和软件公司的信息泄露问题 而这些谴责就如同 在责备Al Gore 带来全球变暖问题一样 (笑) (鼓掌) 那么，我们该怎么办？ 我们需要担忧吗？不 我们应该为这些丑恶的、无礼的、不该发生的事情 而愤怒 但这些对改变现实无济于事 对于世界其它国家来说解决这一问题的方法 就是尝试避开 美国建立的这些系统 但这说起来容易做起来难 该怎么做呢 任何一个欧洲国家 都没有能力替代 美国制造的操作系统和云服务 但也许我们可以不用孤军奋战 而是与其它国家联合 这个解决方案是开源的 通过一同构建这样一个开放、免费并安全的系统 我们可以绕开监视 并且每个国家都不再只靠自己的力量 而只需要解决一个小问题 我们的安全专家Haroon Meer说过 每个国家都只能成为一个小水波 而聚在一起就可以掀起巨浪 从而可以同时载起所有的小船 这个安全，免费并开源的系统 将成为推动我们所有人的彭波巨浪 使我们可以从此 彻底逃脱国家的监视 谢谢大家 (鼓掌) 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Iran and Israel: Peace is possible</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Iran and Israel: two nations with tense relations that seem existentially at odds. But for all their antagonistic rhetoric, there is a recent hidden history of collaboration, even friendship. In an informative talk, Trita Parsi shows how an unlikely strategic alliance in the past could mean peace in the future for these two feuding countries. 	<br><br>

Iran is Israel's best friend, and we do not intend to change our position in relation to Tehran. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:19	<br><br>
	
Believe it or not, this is a quote from an Israeli prime minister, but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir from the era of the Shah. It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin. The year is 1987. Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive, and much like Ahmadinejad today, he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel. Yet, Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
Today, when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric, we're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable Middle Eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I hope today to show you why that is. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive, starting in 539 B.C., when King Cyrus the Great of Persia liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity. A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia. They're today's Iraqi Jews. A third migrated to Persia. They're today's Iranian Jews, still 25,000 of them living in Iran, making them the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. And a third returned to historic Palestine, did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
But even in modern times, relations have been close at times. Rabin's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two, which in turn was born out of perception of common threats. Both states feared the Soviet Union and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq. And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery, the idea that Israel's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non-Arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity. Now, from the Shah's perspective, though, he wanted to keep this as secret as possible, so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance, traveled to Iran in the '70s, he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him. The Iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal, so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:03	<br><br>
	
Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution in 1979? In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology of the new regime, the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on, because they still had common threats. And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Israel feared an Iraqi victory and actively helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's American weaponry at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable because of an American arms embargo that Israel was more than happy to violate. In fact, back in the 1980s, it was Israel that lobbied Washington to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran, and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology. And this, of course, climaxed in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
But with the end of the Cold War came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace. Suddenly, the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades, more or less evaporated. The Soviet Union collapsed, Iraq was defeated, and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure, but they were also now left unchecked. Without Iraq balancing Iran, Iran could now become a threat, some in Israel argued. In fact, the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of 1979, because at this point, Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region, and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners, they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors. So Israel, who in the 1980s lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement, thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense, and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:26	<br><br>
	
Ironically, this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel's destruction. Iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism, and after having helped the United States indirectly in the war against Iraq in 1991, the Iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included in the post-war security architecture of the region. But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach, as it would a decade later in Afghanistan, and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation, and it is at this point, around 1993, '94, that Iran begins to translate its anti-Israeli ideology into operational policy. The Iranians believed that whatever they did, even if they moderated their policies, the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation, and the only way Iran could compel Washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the U.S. if it didn't. The easiest target was the peace process, and now the Iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite, and Iran began supporting extensively Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously had shunned. In some ways, this sounds paradoxical, but according to Martin Indyk of the Clinton administration, the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong, because the more peace there would be between Israel and Palestine, the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated. The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be. So according to Indyk, and these are his words, the Iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment. To defeat our policy of containment, not about ideology. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement, all sides have reached out to each other. Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996, reached out to the Iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected. Tehran was not interested. A few years later, the Iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration, a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again. The Bush administration did not even respond. All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
But this is not an ancient conflict. This is not even an ideological conflict. The ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal, but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape. When Iran and Israel's security imperatives dictated collaboration, they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other. When Iran's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests, the strategic interests always prevailed. This is good news, because it means that neither war nor enmity is a foregone conclusion. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:02	<br><br>
	
But some want war. Some believe or say that it's 1938, Iran is Germany, and Ahmadinejad is Hitler. If we accept this to be true, that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany, Ahmadinejad is Hitler, then the question we have to ask ourself is, who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain? Who will risk peace? This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy, and when you eliminate diplomacy, you make war inevitable. In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce, no draw, no compromise, only victory or defeat. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:50	<br><br>
	
But rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological, we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible. Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon, only a few decades old in a history of 2,500 years, and precisely because its roots are geopolitical, it means that solutions can be found, compromises can be struck, however difficult it yet may be. After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said, "You don't make peace with your friends. You make it with your enemies." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:31	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

“伊朗是以色列最好的朋友 而且我们也不打算就德黑兰的问题 改变我们的立场。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:19	<br><br>
	
信不信由你，这些话 直接引述自以色列总理 这个首相不是伊朗国王时代的 班古里安或戈尔迪 梅厄森 它其实是伊扎克 拉宾说的 在1987年的时候 阿亚图拉 霍梅尼现在还在世 就像今天的艾哈迈迪内贾德一样 他对以色列用了最差的措辞 但拉宾依然把伊朗 当作地缘战略伙伴 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
今天，当我们听到战争的恐吓 和花言巧语 我们时常去相信 这是另一个尚未解决的 中东争端 争端的渊源和宗教一样 有极长的历史 事实上，没有什么比这一点更加偏离事实了。 我希望今天来告诉你们 为什么会这样 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
伊朗人和犹太人的关系 从古至今总体上来说是较好的 那是从公元前539年 当波斯王朝的国王 居鲁士（又译塞勒斯） 解放了被巴比伦囚禁的犹太人 三分之一的犹太人 留在了巴比伦 他们就是今天的伊拉克犹太人 三分之一移民到了波斯 他们就是今天的伊朗犹太人 仍有 25,000人生活在伊朗， 他们成为了除以色列外 中东地区最大的犹太社群 三分之一回到了历史上的巴勒斯坦 在耶路撒冷第二次重建了圣殿 顺便说一下，用的是波斯的税钱 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
不过，即使在当代 有时关系也会变得比较密切 拉宾的声明是反映了 两国间几十年来的安全和情报合作 反过来说，这样的合作 也是出于对某些共同威胁的担忧 这两个国家都害怕苏联 和一些强大的阿拉伯国家， 例如埃及和伊拉克 此外，以色列信奉的地缘政治 其理念是，以色列的国家安全目标 最好能通过与 非阿拉伯国家联盟达成 在其领土的周围 以平衡其附近的阿拉伯国家的力量 尽管现在，从伊朗国王的角度看， 他想要尽可能保守这个秘密 所以当伊扎克 ・ 拉宾，例如， 在七十年代，造访伊朗的时候 他通常戴着假发 这样就没有人能认出他来 伊朗人在德黑兰机场 建造了特别的停机坪 离中央航站楼很远 所以没有人会注意到 大批的以色列飞机穿梭于 特拉维夫和德黑兰之间 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:03	<br><br>
	
现在，所有这一切都随着伊斯兰革命 在 1979 年结束了吗？ 尽管新的政权有很清晰的 反以色列意识形态 两国在地缘政治逻辑下的合作 还在继续着 因为他们仍面对共同的威胁 当1980年，伊拉克入侵伊朗的时候 以色列担心伊拉克会赢得战争 便积极行动帮助伊朗， 对其出售武器和提供备件 为伊朗提供美国武器装备 当时伊朗非常脆弱 由于美国对其实行武器禁运 以色列却非常乐意违反这条禁令 事实上，早在 20 世纪 80 年代， 是以色列游说华盛顿 与伊朗会谈，向伊朗出售武器 并不要在意伊朗的反以色列意识形态 当然，这在1980年代 伊朗反政府丑闻中 被推到风口浪尖 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
但随着冷战的结束 以色列和伊朗间的冷和平 也结束了 突然，那两个共同的威胁 那几十年来推动着他们互相靠近的威胁 或多或少地消失了 苏联解体了 伊拉克被打败了 一个新的环境在该区域中形成了 这个新环境让两国都更有安全感 但也使他们都无法被约束 没有伊拉克制衡伊朗 伊朗现在可被视为一种威胁， 以色列一些人这样争论到 事实上，就当前的形势 那些你所看到的发生在 伊朗与以色列之间的事 其根源开始于 冷战结束后该地区 地缘政治的结构发生了变化 而不是1979年的一系列事件 因为冷战结束后，伊朗和以色列 成为该地区两个最强大的国家 比起视对方为 潜在的安全伙伴， 他们越来越将对方 视作竞争对手 以色列那些在八十年代 为改善美国伊朗关系而游说的人 现在担心美国伊朗会和解 认为那将牺牲 以色列的安全利益 而且试图将伊朗 放在越来越被他国孤立的位置 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:26	<br><br>
	
讽刺的是，那时 伊朗更有兴趣 与华盛顿和解 而不是去理会以色列的破坏 伊朗用激进主义 将自己放在了孤立的位置 在间接帮助美国 1991 年对伊拉克的战争后 伊朗人希望 他们会因此得到回报 从而被纳入该地区的 战后安全体系 但华盛顿选择忽略伊朗的示好 十年后在阿富汗他们也是这样， 同时加紧对伊朗的孤立 就在1993,1994年的时候 伊朗开始将 其反以色列的意识形态 化为实施方针 伊朗人相信不管他们做什么 即使他们缓和自己的政策， 美国将继续对伊朗的孤立 而伊朗唯一可能迫使华盛顿 改变其态度的方法便是 让美国如果不做出改变 就要为此付出代价 最容易的目标是和平进程， 现在的伊朗意识形态的吼叫 伴随着非惯用的手段 伊朗开始广泛支持 那些他曾回避的 巴勒斯坦伊斯兰团体 某种程度上，这听起来很荒谬 但根据克林顿政府的 马丁 安迪克（的作为） 伊朗人的策略也并不是完全错误 因为当以色列和巴勒斯坦 越发和平 美国认为，伊朗越发会被孤立 伊朗越是被孤立， 以色列和巴勒斯坦才会越和平 所以依照安迪克所说 “伊朗人的兴趣在于在和平进程中 打击我们， 以此打败我们的遏制政策。” 要打败我们的遏制政策 不是意识形态。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
但在他们整个的纠缠中，甚至是最糟糕的时代 所有双方互相都达成共识。 当内塔尼亚胡在1996年当选总理时 他向伊朗人伸出了手 寻找有无任何 重建外围合作的可能 可德黑兰对此不感兴趣 几年后，伊朗人 向布什政府提出了全面谈判的提案 这个提案认为存在一些 使伊朗和以色列恢复关系的可能 布什政府却并没有响应 双方就这样错失了 每一个机会 	<br><br>

但这不是古老的冲突 这甚至不是意识形态的冲突 敌对状态的起起伏伏 并不会因为意识形态而变化 而是根据地缘政治格局而变化 当伊朗和以色列为了安全考量 需要合作时，他们这样做了 尽管彼此的意识形态依旧强烈反对对方 当伊朗的意识形态 与它的战略利益出现冲突时 战略利益始终占上风 这是个好消息，因为它意味着 既没有战争也没有仇怨 是注定要发生的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:02	<br><br>
	
但有些人想要战争 有些人相信甚至说 如果现在是1938 年 伊朗就是德国， 艾哈迈迪内贾德是希特勒 如果我们将此视为事实 事实上它就是1938年，伊朗就是德国， 艾哈迈迪内贾德就是希特勒， 那我们给自己出了一个问题， 谁愿意来扮演内维尔 ・ 张伯伦的角色？ 谁将拿和平来冒险？ 这个类比意在 去除外交考量 当你除去外交考量 战争将无法避免 在意识形态的冲突中， 没有休战 没有平局， 没有妥协， 只有胜利或失败 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:50	<br><br>
	
然而比起将两国间矛盾 视为意识形态的冲突 进而使得战争无法避免 更明智的作法是， 积极寻求方法 创造和平的可能 伊朗和以色列的冲突是一种新现象 只是在长达2500 年的历史长河中的 几十年 而且正是因为冲突的根源在于地缘政治 这也意味着 是可以找到办法来解决的 两国可以达成和解 尽管它可能非常艰难 但是毕竟，这是拉宾自己说的 "你不需要和你的朋友讲和 而要和你的敌人和解"。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">How I hacked online dating</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating. The dates she liked didn't write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and worse). So, as any fan of data would do: she started making a spreadsheet. Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online dating life ― with frustrating, funny and life-changing results. 	<br><br>

So my name is Amy Webb, and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion. And I thought, you know, what's wrong with me? I don't understand why this keeps happening. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:27	<br><br>
	
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought. I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice, and she said, "Stop being so picky. You've got to date around. And most importantly, true love will find you when you least expect it." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
Now as it turns out, I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data, as you'll soon find. I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts. I also have a very tight-knit family, and I'm very, very close with my sister, and as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup, I'm 30 years old, I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate, and we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged. And if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35, that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago. So that wasn't going to work. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:26	<br><br>
	
If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love, then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity. In short, I was trying to figure out, well, what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right? Well, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia, and it's a big city, and I figured, in this entire place, there are lots of possibilities. So again, I started doing some math. Population of Philadelphia: It has 1.5 million people. I figure about half of that are men, so that takes the number down to 750,000. I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36, which was only four percent of the population, so now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men. I was looking for somebody who was Jewish, because that's what I am and that was important to me. That's only 2.3 percent of the population. I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men, and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
In the meantime, my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children, and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
So if I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out. One, I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least-expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men in the entire 1.5 million-person city of Philadelphia, or I could try online dating. Now, I like the idea of online dating, because it's predicated on an algorithm, and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem, I'm going to use some data, run it through a system and get to a solution. So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other, but as it turns out, algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture. In fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers a long time ago, and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se, they definitely were running through formulas in their heads, like, is the girl going to like the boy? Are the families going to get along? What's the rabbi going to say? Are they going to start having children right away? And the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this, put two people together, and that would be the end of it. So in my case, I thought, well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming? So I decided to sign on. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
Now, there was one small catch. As I'm signing on to the various dating websites, as it happens, I was really, really busy. But that actually wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind, and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes. So I just copied and pasted from my résumé. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
So in the descriptive part up top, I said that I was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker. When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date, I said monetization and fluency in Japanese. I talked a lot about JavaScript. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:37	<br><br>
	
So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward. But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date. These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates -- what turned out to be truly awful dates. There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy. The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets, we share a love of math and data and '80s music, and so I agreed to go out with him. So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth, extremely expensive restaurants. And we went in, and right off the bat, our conversation really wasn't taking flight, but he was ordering a lot of food. In fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu. He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well, and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table, also lots and lots of bottles of wine. So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner, and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other, but we'll part ways as friends, when he gets up to go to the bathroom, and in the meantime the bill comes to our table. And listen, I'm a modern woman. I am totally down with splitting the bill. But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back. (Gasping) And that was my entire month's rent. So needless to say, I was not having a good night. So I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister, and as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates, I regale them with the details. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:17	<br><br>
	
And they say to me, "Stop complaining." (Laughter) "You're just being too picky." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:25	<br><br>
	
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know that there's wi-fi, and I'm bringing my laptop. I'm going to shove it into my bag, and I'm going to have this email template, and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically, these dates really are terrible. (Laughter) So I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks; bad vocabulary; the number of times a man forced me to high-five him. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:53	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:55	<br><br>
	
So I started to crunch some numbers, and that allowed me to make some correlations. So as it turns out, for some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:10	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:12	<br><br>
	
Well, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys. There were just bad for me. And as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up, they weren't bad either. These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do, which was to take our user-generated information, in my case, my résumé, and match it up with other people's information. See, the real problem here is that, while the algorithms work just fine, you and I don't, when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online. Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves. The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like, are you a dog person or a cat person? Do you like horror films or romance films? I'm not looking for a pen pal. I'm looking for a husband. Right? So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
So I said fine, I've got a new plan. I'm going to keep using these online dating sites, but I'm going to treat them as databases, and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up, I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system. So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people, I decided instead to ask my own questions. What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:30	<br><br>
	
So I started writing and writing and writing, and at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points. I wanted somebody was Jew...ish, so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture, but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday. I wanted somebody who worked hard, because work for me is extremely important, but not too hard. For me, the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children, but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do, so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three, and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it. So things like that, but I also wanted somebody who would go to far-flung, exotic places, like Petra, Jordan. I also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times, regardless of what I weighed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:27	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:30	<br><br>
	
So I now have these 72 different data points, which, to be fair, is a lot. So what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list. I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points, and I ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91, and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart, who would challenge and stimulate me, and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points. These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system, because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. For 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date, and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the 1,500 point threshold. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:29	<br><br>
	
Well, as it turns out, this worked pretty well. So I go back online now. I found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken, he had hiked Mt. Fuji, he had walked along the Great Wall. He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship. And I thought, I've done it! I've cracked the code. I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:57	<br><br>
	
There was only one problem: He didn't like me back. And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. Who are all of the other women on these dating sites? I found SmileyGirl1978. She said she was a "fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing." She listed her job as teacher. She said she is "silly, nice and friendly." She likes to make people laugh "alot." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
At this moment I knew, clicking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this, that I needed to do some market research. So I created 10 fake male profiles. Now, before I lose all of you -- (Laughter) -- understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system. I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody. I really was just scraping their data. But I didn't want everybody's data. I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:01	<br><br>
	
When I released these men into the wild, I did follow some rules. So I didn't reach out to any woman first. I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract, and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. So I was looking at qualitative data, so what was the humor, the tone, the voice, the communication style that these women shared in common? And also quantitative data, so what was the average length of their profile, how much time was spent between messages? What I was trying to get at here was that I figured in person, I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978. I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
Well, one month later, I had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis. And as it turns out, content matters a lot. So smart people tend to write a lot -- 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves, which may all be very, very interesting. The challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very, very well, even though it may not seem like it all the time. The other sort of hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non-specific language. So in my case, you know, "The English Patient" is my most favorite movie ever, but it doesn't work to use that in a profile, because that's a superficial data point, and somebody may disagree with me and decide they don't want to go out with me because they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:27	<br><br>
	
Also, optimistic language matters a lot. So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women, words like "fun" and "girl" and "love." And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile. Remember, I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that. The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
And as it turns out, timing is also really, really important. Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake, doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people. The popular women on these online sites spend an average of 23 hours in between each communication. And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:18	<br><br>
	
And finally, there were the photos. All of the women who were popular showed some skin. They all looked really great, which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:33	<br><br>
	
Once I had all of this information, I was able to create a super profile, so it was still me, but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem. And as it turns out, I did a really good job. I was the most popular person online. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:51	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:57	<br><br>
	
And as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me. So I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother. I'm telling them about this fabulous news, and they say, "This is wonderful! How soon are you going out?" And I said, "Well, actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody." Because remember, in my scoring system, they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points, and none of them have done that. They said, "What? You're still being too damn picky." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin, and he said that he was culturally Jewish, he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter, which I thought was very clever. He talked in detail about travel. He made a lot of really interesting cultural references. He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted, and immediately, he scored 850 points. It was enough for a date. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:46	<br><br>
	
Three weeks later, we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant, and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re-scored him -- [1,050 points!] -- thought, you know what, this entire time I haven't been picky enough. Well, a year and a half after that, we were non-cruise ship traveling through Petra, Jordan, when he got down on his knee and proposed. A year after that, we were married, and about a year and a half after that, our daughter, Petra, was born. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:29	<br><br>
	
Obviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so -- (Laughter) -- the question is, what does all of this mean for you? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:36	<br><br>
	
Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love. It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. In fact, it's something that you write yourself. So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business, all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules, and feel free to be as picky as you want. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:59	<br><br>
	
Well, on my wedding day, I had a conversation again with my grandmother, and she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong. It looks like you did come up with a really, really great system. Now, your matzoh balls. They should be fluffy, not hard." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:14	<br><br>
	
And I'll take her advice on that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:16	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
我的名字呢 叫艾米・韦伯 几年前 我发现自己走到 又一段美好恋情的尽头 一切绚丽消逝 你说我 到底怎么了？ 真不懂 为什么每次都这样 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:27	<br><br>
	
我就去问 身边的人 看他们 怎么想 我找到 姥姥 她总有 很多忠告 她说 “别太挑剔了" “你得 多跟人谈谈" “还有 最重要的是“ “顺其自然 缘分始终会来的“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
而实际上 我这个人 总要找依据 这点相信你 很快会发现 我总是沉浸在 数字当中 长期和公式 图表打交道 同时 我的家庭 非常和睦 我和姐姐 关系特别好 所以 从小我就想 长大以后 要有一个温暖的大家庭 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
所以这次分手 很伤心 我当时30岁 想着 起码要和下一任 交往6个月 才能真正 确定关系 然后再考虑 搬一起住 之后再过段时间 才考虑订婚 所以 如果想在35岁之前 要孩子 就意味着我必须 提前5年为结婚做准备 很明显 那行不通 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:26	<br><br>
	
如果换个思路 “顺其自然”等缘分 那么 我要面临的变数 是运气 那么 我要面临的变数 是运气 简单来说 我想探个究竟 看看 随缘偶遇真命天子 概率有多高 当时我呢 住在费城 这是个大城市 所以我判断 地方越大 机会越大 接着我又开始 算数了 费城人口：总共150万 估计 一半是男性 有效人数 下降到75万 我的目标是 30到36岁之间的男性 他们 占这部分人口的4% 算起来 可能剩下3万人 我要找 犹太人 因为我本身也是 这点很重要 他们只占 这部分人口的2.3% 然后 估计10个人当中 有1个我喜欢 然后 估计10个人当中 有1个我喜欢 还有 我和爱打高尔夫的 完全合不来 还有 我和爱打高尔夫的 完全合不来 也就是说 对我而言 费城总共有35位男士 适宜约会 在整个费城！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
与此同时 我们犹太大家族 其他成员 全部都结了婚 而且还生了 很多很多孩子 所以我总有 巨大的压力和紧迫感 要尽快解决 人生大事 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
这时候 我有两个办法 我发现 一是 可以听姥姥的话 尝试“顺其自然” 碰上那一位 尝试“顺其自然” 碰上那一位 在费城茫茫 150万人海中 偶遇那35位男士 其中的一位 又或者 我可以试试婚恋网 其实我挺喜欢 这个概念 因为我们可以 用运算规则推算结果 所谓运算规则 其实很简单 当我们遇到问题 只要收集数据 放到系统里面 就能找到解决办法 放到系统里面 就能找到解决办法 婚恋网 现在已经成为大家 互相认识的 第二大途径 不过 网站的运算规则 在几千年前 就可以找到 例如犹太族 从很早以前就有媒人 例如犹太族 从很早以前就有媒人 虽然他们没有 列出公式 但在脑子里 一定琢磨过这些问题 比如 女孩会喜欢男孩吗？ 两家人能处得来吗？ 拉比(犹太教教师或法学导师)会怎么说？ 他们会不会马上生孩子？ 媒人们会 先想好这些问题 再把两个人凑到一起 就完事了 而我呢 我想 能不能通过数据和公式 帮我找到白马王子？ 我决定注册 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
这里还有一个小插曲 我开设了几个婚恋网帐户 碰巧那段时间特别 特别忙 不过那还不是 最大的问题 最大的 问题是 我讨厌填 问答表 尤其不喜欢 时尚杂志小编爱问的题目 尤其不喜欢 时尚杂志小编爱问的题目 所以我直接把简历 复制粘贴上去 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
上面 描述部分 我说我是 获奖记者 和未来思考者 让我描述兴趣爱好和理想人选 我填了 赚钱 和日语流利 还写了很多关于 网页编码的内容 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:37	<br><br>
	
这一步 走得确实不太优雅 这一步 走得确实不太优雅 最根本的问题是 还是有很多男士 和我约会 配对公式 为我找到一大批男士 他们不断约我－－ 可结果却特别糟糕 其中有一位 叫史蒂夫的技术男 配对公式 发现我们都对小玩意着迷 配对公式 发现我们都对小玩意着迷 我们是数学迷 数据迷 还是80年代歌迷 我同意见他 然后这位技术男 带我到 费城一家 特别高消费的西餐厅 费城一家 特别高消费的西餐厅 刚到 我们就发现 谈得 不太有意思 但他 点了很多吃的 他餐牌都 不用看 就点了几份 开胃菜 几份主食 还帮我点了 忽然间 桌上堆满了大盘小盘吃的 还有 很多很多瓶酒 在我们 谈得差不多 晚餐也 接近尾声的时候 我确信和技术男 并非天生一对 但再见 还可以是朋友 他去趟 洗手间 帐单也来了 看 我是现代女性 平分帐单完全没问题 但 技术男却没回来（倒吸气） 而那是我 整整一个月的房租 不用说 我那天晚上很不好受 跑回家之后 我打电话找妈妈 找姐姐 每一次经历这些 糟糕至极的约会之后 我都会 打给她们 我披露 每一个细节 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:17	<br><br>
	
之后 她们对我说 “别抱怨了” （笑声） “你就是太挑” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:25	<br><br>
	
我说 好吧 那以后 我只去 有无线网络的地方约会 要带上 手提电脑 把它 塞到袋子里 然后做一个 邮件模版 把收集到的信息 填进去 一边约会 一边填 用客观事实 向大家证实 这些约会 究竟有多糟糕 （笑声） 我开始 记录那些 无聊又尴尬的 性暗示语言 不适当的用词 还有对方 逼我与他击掌的次数 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:53	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:55	<br><br>
	
然后我开始 统计这些数据 并且找到 一些关联 我发现 不知为什么 喝苏格兰威士忌的男性 立马联想到 性怪癖 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:10	<br><br>

当然 不是说 他们不好 只是 不适合我 同样 把我们凑到一起的 配对公式 也不差 它们按预先设计好的 正常运行 它们按预先设计好的 正常运行 用提取到的 用户信息 比如 我的简历 再和其他人的信息 配对 可见 真正的问题是 虽然公式会按部就班 我们却没有 当我们面对 空白栏 填写 个人信息的地方 没有多少人 可以赤裸裸地 描述完全真实的自己 另一个问题是 网站总爱问 你喜欢猫还是喜欢狗？ 爱看惊悚片还是爱情片？之类的问题 我又不是来找笔友 我在找丈夫 对吧？ 而这些数据 比较肤浅 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
所以 我有个新计划 继续上 婚恋网 但只把它们当作 资料库 而不是继续 被动地等公式配对 我要把整个系统反过来 重新定义 既然公式配对 用的是肤浅信息 既然公式配对 用的是肤浅信息 我决定 自己问问题 我要找的 另一半 需要具备 哪些条件呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:30	<br><br>
	
我开始写 不停地写 到最后 我积攒了72个数据点 到最后 我积攒了72个数据点 我想找 犹太人 找一个与我有 共同文化背景和观点的人 找一个与我有 共同文化背景和观点的人 但他又不会 强迫我 每周五六去 犹太集会 我想找一个 勤奋的人 因为我觉得 工作特别重要 但不能 工作狂 对我来说 我的兴趣 无非是我的 一些新项目 我还想找一个 打算生两个小孩 而且在育儿方面和我 观点一致的人 也就是说 他完全不介意 要孩子三岁学钢琴 可能还外加一些 电脑课 如果 条件允许的话 除此之外 我还想找一个 愿意 远足异乡的人 一起去 约旦的彼得拉 还有 我希望他 比我重20磅 不论时间 也不论我当时 体重是多少 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:27	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:30	<br><br>
	
有了这 72个数据点 说实话 还真不少了 接下来着 我整理出 优先次序 分两层 排列这些数据点 然后从100 排到91？ 写的有 我希望找一个 很聪明的人 一个可以给我带来 挑战和刺激的人 然后在第二层 放上 另外一组数据点 这些对我 同样重要 但不是 必不可少 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
列表完毕 之后 我开始 建立计分系统 我想尝试 借助数学计算出 我想尝试 借助数学计算出 我和网站人选 是否匹配 我和网站人选 是否匹配 我想 对方至少要达到700分 才给他 发电子邮件 或者 回信 达到900分 才答应约会 我不会轻易 投入感情 除非对方 超过1500分才可以考虑 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:29	<br><br>
	
这个方法 还挺有效的 我回到 婚恋网 发现了 Jewishdoc57 他出奇地帅 而且谈吐出众 曾经登上 富士山 徒步长城 而且他喜欢旅行 只要没有游船就好 我想 我成功了！ 编码已被破解 我终于发现了 犹太白马王子 正如 家人所愿 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:57	<br><br>
	
问题 只有一个 他 并不喜欢我 看来有一个变数 我还没考虑 那就是 竞争对手 社交网站 都有哪些 其他的女性？ 社交网站 都有哪些 其他的女性？ 我发现了 SmileyGirl1978 她说她是 "快乐、活泼、有趣的女孩" 她填写的职业是 教师 她说她 "很傻 很友善“ “常常”爱逗大家笑 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
就在那一刻 在点击完一个又一个 类似的个人档案之后 我知道还需要 市场调研 接着我建立了 10个虚拟的 男士档案 在人都 走光之前 （笑声）- 我想请大家 谅解我的初衷 仅仅是 收集数据 去了解系统内的 其他人 我并没有 借此进行任何不道德的交流 确实只是 收集数据 还不是 所有人的数据 仅限女性 那些 我的理想伴侣 可能会喜欢的女性（笑声） 我的理想伴侣 可能会喜欢的女性（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:01	<br><br>
	
我把虚拟男士 放出来之后 还遵守了 一些规矩 首先我没有 主动联系女性 只等着看 能吸引到谁 主要关注点 有两方面 首先是 定性数据 比如 幽默感 语调 声音 沟通方式 这些女性 的共通点是什么？ 还有 定量数据 比如 个人档案的平均长度 两次通信之间 隔多久 我想证明的是 如果有机会 面对面交流 我的竞争力 不比SmileyGirl1978差 所以 我想知道怎么调整 网上档案 才能最好地 呈现自己 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
一个月 之后 我收集了大量数据 足够再分析一回 结果发现 内容很重要 聪明的人 往往写很多 ― ― 3、4千 甚至5千字 自我介绍 也许真的 非常非常有意思 但 很难匹敌 最受欢迎男女 精选的97个字 精选的97个字 虽然我们不一定 感觉得到 高手们的另外一个杀手锏 是不特定语言 以我为例 你看 "英国病人" 是我 最喜欢的电影 但它不适合 放在个人档案里面 因为这是一个 肤浅的数据点 有人可能 会有不同意见 并且 决定不和我约会 仅仅因为他们不愿意 花三个小时看一场电影 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:27	<br><br>
	
还有 积极正面的语言很重要 看这些关键词 里面是 最常用的词语 最受欢迎女性 都在用 比如 "有趣" “女孩” 还有 “爱” 后来 我意识到 没必要写一个 低智商简介 还记得吗 我说 我能讲流利的日语 并且熟悉网页编码 这些都 没问题 重点是 怎么写 让自己显得更亲切 让别人知道 怎么采取主动 让别人知道 怎么采取主动 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:54	<br><br>
	
除此之外 时机也非常重要 当我们拿到 别人的 手机号码 或者 聊天帐号 碰巧凌晨2点还没睡 也许不是 联系他们的好时机 最受欢迎的女性 一般会等 23小时 再进行 下一次沟通 这也是我们 约会时的常规 这也是我们 约会时的常规 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:18	<br><br>
	
最后 轮到照片了 所有 受欢迎女性 都会 露一些 她们 看起来很棒 形成 鲜明对比的 是我当时 上传的照片 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:33	<br><br>
	
掌握了 这些信息之后 我建立了一个 超级档案 我 还是我 只是 在这个生态系统当中 更优化的我 事实证明 我做得很不错 成了婚恋网 最受欢迎的人 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:51	<br><br>
	
（笑声） （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:57	<br><br>
	
后来 特别特别多男人想和我约会 我又打电话给 妈妈 姐姐 和姥姥 告诉她们 这个好消息 她们说 "真棒 ！“ “什么时候开始约会呀？" 然后我说 "嗯 我不会跟任何一个约会的" 因为 记得吧 要在计分系统 至少达到700分才行 这些男士们 都还不够 她们就说 "什么？你还是太挑剔了" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
然后 没过多久 我发现这个人 戴文宁（Thevenin） 他说他 接受犹太风俗 还说他的工作是 猎捕北极小海豹 我觉得 这个说法很有意思 他详谈了很多 关于旅行的事 引用了各种 有趣的文化 他外表和谈吐 都是我想要的 当场就 拿下850分 够约会了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:46	<br><br>
	
三个星期之后 我们见面 谈了足足 14小时 从咖啡店 到餐厅 到另一家咖啡厅 再到下一家餐厅 那天晚上 他送我回家之后 我重新评估 [1,050分!]-- 看来 我一直还 不够挑剔 一年半之后 我们去旅游 当然没有坐游船 在约旦的 佩特拉 他单膝下跪 求婚 一年之后 我们结婚 又过了一年半 我们的女儿 佩特拉 出生了 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:29	<br><br>
	
可以看到 我很享受这段精彩人生 不过 （笑声）- 问题是 这一切对你有什么意义？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:36	<br><br>
	
事实可以证明 爱有计算规则 但不是我们 在网上看到的那些 而是 你自己写出来的 所以无论你要 寻觅另一半 还是 找回激情 又或者 要创业 只需要 真真切切地 找出自己的框架 按自己的规则 进行发挥 爱多挑剔 就多挑剔 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:59	<br><br>
	
最后 在我的婚礼上 我和姥姥 又谈了一回 她说 "好吧 也许是我错了“ “看来 你确实做了” “一个 很棒很厉害的系统“ “可是 你的玛索球” “该松软些 不能太硬了” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:14	<br><br>
	
这个意见 我赞成 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:16	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Leather and meat without killing animals</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
By 2050, it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world's population with meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods. Maintaining this herd will take a huge, potentially unsustainable toll on the planet. What if there were a different way? In this eye-opening talk, tissue engineering advocate Andras Forgacs argues that biofabricating meat and leather is a civilized way to move past killing animals for hamburgers and handbags. 	<br><br>

When my father and I started a company to 3D print human tissues and organs, some people initially thought we were a little crazy. But since then, much progress has been made, both in our lab and other labs around the world. And given this, we started getting questions like, "If you can grow human body parts, can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:38	<br><br>
	
When someone first suggested this to me, quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy, but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all. What's crazy is what we do today. I'm convinced that in 30 years, when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags, we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy. Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods? And over the next few decades, as the world's population expands to 10 billion, this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:27	<br><br>
	
But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet. Animals are not just raw materials. They're living beings, and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water, and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change. On top of this, when you get so many animals so close together, it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse. Clearly, we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment, public health, and food security at risk. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:06	<br><br>
	
There is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues, and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. What if, instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal, we started with what the tissues are made of, the basic unit of life, the cell? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:37	<br><br>
	
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs. Already in medicine, biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts, like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone, that have been successfully implanted into patients. And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
And we should begin by reimagining leather. I emphasize leather because it is so widely used. It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history. Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two-dimensional. It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators. Until biofabrication is better understood, it is clear that, initially at least, more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods, no matter how delicious. In this sense, leather is a gateway material, a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. If we can succeed here, it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:07	<br><br>
	
Now how do we do it? To grow leather, we begin by taking cells from an animal, through a simple biopsy. The animal could be a cow, lamb, or even something more exotic. This process does no harm, and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. We then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium. This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions. And we then coax these cells to produce collagen, as they would naturally. This collagen is the stuff between cells. It's natural connective tissue. It's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block. And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets, and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another, like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets, which we then let mature. And finally, we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process, we create leather. And so I'm very excited to show you, for the first time, the first batch of our cultured leather, fresh from the lab. This is real, genuine leather, without the animal sacrifice. It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells, and better yet, there is no hair to remove, no scars or insect's bites, and no waste. This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat. It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:58	<br><br>
	
And because we make this material, we grow this leather from the ground up, we can control its properties in very interesting ways. This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick, and as you can see, it is nearly transparent. And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque. You don't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather. And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities, like softness, breathability, durability, elasticity and even things like pattern. We can mimic nature, but in some ways also improve upon it. This type of leather can do what today's leather does, but with imagination, probably much more. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:55	<br><br>
	
What could the future of animal products look like? It need not look like this, which is actually the state of the art today. Rather, it could be much more like this. Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years, beginning with products like wine, beer and yogurt. And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved, and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful, sterile facilities like this. A brewery is essentially a bioreactor. It is where cell culture takes place. Imagine that in this facility, instead of brewing beer, we were brewing leather or meat. Imagine touring this facility, learning about how the leather or meat is cultured, seeing the process from beginning to end, and even trying some. It's clean, open and educational, and this is in contrast to the hidden, guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today. Perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind. It's environmentally responsible, efficient and humane. It allows us to be creative. We can design new materials, new products, and new facilities. We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:41	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">The rise of the new global super-rich  </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Technology is advancing in leaps and bounds ― and so is economic inequality, says writer Chrystia Freeland. In an impassioned talk, she charts the rise of a new class of plutocrats (those who are extremely powerful because they are extremely wealthy), and suggests that globalization and new technology are actually fueling, rather than closing, the global income gap. Freeland lays out three problems with plutocracy … and one glimmer of hope. 	<br><br>

So here's the most important economic fact of our time. We are living in an age of surging income inequality, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K., but it's a global phenomenon. It's happening in communist China, in formerly communist Russia, it's happening in India, in my own native Canada. We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like Sweden, Finland and Germany. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. In the 1970s, the One Percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States. Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent. But what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution. The 0.1 percent in the U.S. today account for more than eight percent of the national income. They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago. Let me give you another number to put that in perspective, and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population, 120 million people. Now, as it happens, Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat, he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon, and he has his own favorite number. Buffett likes to point out that in 1992, the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars. Just think about it. You didn't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992. Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled to 1.7 trillion, and I probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class, whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy, but we've been slow to notice it. One of the reasons, I think, is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon. Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog. But I think there's something else going on. Talking about income inequality, even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list, can make us feel uncomfortable. It feels less positive, less optimistic, to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list, talking about income distribution, and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution, can be downright threatening. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:34	<br><br>
	
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality, especially at the top. What's driving it, and what can we do about it? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:44	<br><br>
	
One set of causes is political: lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services, privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions, all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very, very top. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of "crony capitalism," political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance, or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression, or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies, including those whose motto might be "don't do evil," to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really, really hard, at least intellectually, it's an easy problem. After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. Indeed, this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least, the easy part of the problem, things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality. In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious. Globalization and the technology revolution, the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy, are also powering the rise of the super-rich. Just think about it. For the first time in history, if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product, you have almost instant, almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people. As a result, if you are very, very smart and very, very lucky, you can get very, very rich very, very quickly. The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr recently sold his company to Yahoo for 1.1 billion dollars. Think about that for a minute: 1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old. It's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields, like sports and entertainment. We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. But today, that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. We have superstar technologists. We have superstar bankers. We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. There are even, and this is my personal favorite example, superstar dentists, the most dazzling exemplar of whom is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich or European-born American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:36	<br><br>
	
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy, what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. And that's because, in contrast with crony capitalism, so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. Let's start with technology. I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices. I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. I'm even more of a fan of globalization. This is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class, and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world, it's made many new products affordable -- who do you think built your iPhone? ― and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper. Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
So what's not to like? Well, a few things. One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process. It gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor. And that's no mere hypothetical example. Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks. These are among the world's most admired, most beloved, most innovative companies. They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly. And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage? Once you have the tremendous economic power that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution and the political power that inevitably entails, it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor. Again, this is no mere hypothetical. It's what the Russian oligarchs did in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization of Russia's natural resources. It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:19	<br><br>
	
A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks, and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. The middle class is spending more on schooling too, but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT, the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. The result is something that economists Alan Krueger and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve. As income inequality increases, social mobility decreases. The plutocracy may be a meritocracy, but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most, is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in Western industrialized economies. Let's start with technology. Those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs. When's the last time you used a travel agent? And in contrast with the industrial revolution, the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs. At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000. The same is true of globalization. For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets, it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. That's shown in what I consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time. Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. That means that our countries are getting richer, our companies are getting more efficient, but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people, as a whole, more. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:00	<br><br>
	
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. After all, in a totally free labor market, we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:30	<br><br>
	
So when I get really depressed about all of this, I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. After all, for all its grim, satanic mills, it worked out pretty well, didn't it? After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller -- well, there are a few exceptions ― and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century. But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Long Depression of the 1870s, two world wars, communist revolutions in Russia and in China, and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. We also, not coincidentally, went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions. We created the modern welfare state. We created public education. We created public health care. We created public pensions. We created unions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
Today, we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats, we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. We need a new New Deal. 	<br><br>

当今最重要的经济现状是 我们生活在一个收入差异加巨的年代 特别是处于顶层的人士收入远高于 其它阶层 这种现象在英美最为显著 但全球皆然 包括社会主义制度的中国 前共产主义苏联 印度和我的祖国加拿大 甚至在最适宜居住的社会民主国家 像瑞典，芬兰和德国都是如此 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
我以几个数字为例，大家就会明白 在70年代的美国 (最富有的)1%的人的所得 占据了10%的国民收入 如今，这部分人的收入占有率增加了一倍多 超过20% 更让人震惊的是 顶层中的顶层们 的收入分配 那0.1%尖端人士 拥有全美8%以上的 国民收入 这是30年前顶端1%的占有率 让我再举一个数字来审视这个问题 这是2005年的统计数据 由Robert Reich 提供 他是克林顿政府的劳工部长 Reich以两个无可厚非的巨富 比尔.盖茨和沃伦.巴菲特的财富为例 发现这个总和 相当于全美最底层的40%的全部财富 即1.2亿人的总和 碰巧的是 沃伦 ・ 巴菲特不仅自己是个富豪 同时是此现象最敏锐的观察者之一 他有自己最偏好的数据 巴菲特指出，在1992年 福布斯400强 的财富总和 即最富有的400个美国人 总价值3000 亿美金 试想一下 不用十亿美金 你就可以在1992年跻身福布斯400强 现如今这个数字翻了五倍多 达到1.7万亿美金 不用我说大家便知 类似的增长并没发生在 中产阶级身上 他们的财富增长不是停滞就是减少 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
我们生活在全球财阀统治的时代 但却久久才意识到这一点 我认为其中一个原因 类似于"温水青蛙"现象 缓慢和逐步的变化 很难被注意到 即使最终的结果是致命的 想想那只青蛙悲惨的结局吧 但我认为还有别的原因 当谈到收入不平等时 即使不是福布斯400 强之列的巨富 也会另人感到很不舒服 好似用消极、悲观的态度 来谈论如何切分蛋糕 而不是积极想办法使这块蛋糕变大 如果你有幸跻身福布斯400强 当讨论收入分配 以及随之而来的收入再分配时 你可能会有彻底的威胁感 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:34	<br><br>
	
我们生活在收入不平等加剧的年代 尤其是在顶端人群中 这背后的动因是什么？我们又能做些什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:44	<br><br>
	
其中之一是政治原因 降低税收，放松管制，特别是对金融服务业 私有化，削弱法律对工会的保护 这一切都造成 越来越多的收入集中到社会顶层 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:05	<br><br>
	
很多这些政治因素可以大致归结为 "裙带资本主义" 政治变革使得 密切相关的圈内人士直接受益 而对一般人意义了了 在实践中，铲除裙带资本主义 是非常困难的 以俄罗斯为例，多年来有多少 改革派想尽办法铲除腐败 力尽艰辛重整银行系统 即使是在大萧条以来最严重的 金融危机之后，依然见效不大。 再有，要求那些大型跨国公司 包括一些口口声声宣扬"为善"的公司 根据中产阶级的税率来纳税 是多么困难重重 但尽管在实践中根除裙带资本主义 实属不易 但至少从理智上讲，那是个简单的问题 毕竟，没有人是真正支持裙带资本主义的 事实上这个问题 罕见地统一了左派和右派 批判裙带资本主义对茶党 和占领华尔街派而言同样重要 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
但如果裙带资本主义从理智上讲 是比较容易解决的部分 那么经济因素催成的贫富相差巨增 就变得更为繁杂 就经济本身而言，并无特别神秘之处 但全球化和技术革命 这一对经济转型 正在改变我们的生活 改变着全球经济 也催成超级富豪的崛起 试想一下 有史以来第一次, 如果你是一个充满活力的企业家 有一个绝妙的新点子 或神奇的新产品 你可以立即顺利地 进入超过 10 亿人的全球市场 因此，如果你非常非常的聪明 又非常非常的幸运 你可以 顺间变成富豪 这种现象的最新代言人 是大卫 ・ 卡普 这个26岁的Tumblr 创始人 最近把他的公司卖给了雅虎 成交价11 亿美金 好好想一下 11 亿美金，26 岁 不难发现，技术革命 和全球化是如何创造这种超级巨星效应 在人人可见的领域内 如体育界和娱乐圈 我们都能看到那些出色的运动员 或明星利用他们的能力 在全球市场创造前所未有的价值 但如今，这种巨星效应 发生在整个经济体系中 我们有巨星技术专家 有巨星银行家 巨星律师和巨星建筑师 有巨星厨师 和巨星农场主 甚至有我个人最喜欢的例子 巨星牙医 其中最耀眼的 是这个法国牙医 Bernard Touati 他保障其他巨星们的露齿一笑 其中包括俄罗斯寡头阿布拉莫维奇 欧裔美国时装设计师 黛安 ・ 冯 ・ 弗斯滕伯格 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:36	<br><br>
	
尽管显而易见全球化 和技术革命正在 创造世界超富 难解的是如何看待这一现象 因为 与裙带资本主义相反 全球化和技术革命 带来的收益多是积极向上的 我们先从技术说起 我爱互联网。也爱移动设备 我喜欢 不管是谁在什么地方都能选择观看这个演讲 远远超出这个礼堂的范围 我更是全球化的粉丝 这种转型 使数亿 世界上最贫穷的人民摆脱贫困 进入中产阶级 如果你碰巧住在发达国家 这种转型让许多新产品变得物美价廉- 想想是谁生产的你的 iPhone?― 我们依赖已久的物品变得越来越便宜 看看你的洗碗机或是你的 t 恤 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
那还有什么不喜欢的呢？ 确实有一些 我担心的事情之一 是任人唯才的富豪统治 很容易成为裙带富豪统治 假设你是一位出色的企业家 成功地向全球数十亿人 销售了新产品或新点子 并一下子成为亿万富翁 此时你经不住诱惑 使用你的经济常识去 操作全球政治经济的游戏规则 为自己谋取暴利 这并不只是个假设 看看亚马逊、 苹果、 谷歌、 星巴克 这些都是属于世界上最受尊敬 最受喜爱，最具创新性的公司 他们特别擅长 利用国际税制的差别避税 大大降低税额 那为什么不继续利用现有 全球化政治经济体系 来获得最大利益呢? 因为一旦你拥有巨大的经济实力 像那些处于收入分配顶端的富豪们 以及相关的政治权力 开始尝试改变游戏规则 以谋私利的想法 就会变得非常诱人 再次重申，这绝不是假设 正如俄罗斯寡头们 在前所未有的私有化过程中 出卖俄罗斯天然资源的所作所为一样 这也描绘了英美两国 放松对金融服务业管制 所造成的后果 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:19	<br><br>
	
我担心的第二件事 就是任人唯才的富豪统治 很容易成为贵族统治 形容这些富豪的一种方法 可称他们为技术达人 这些人敏锐地意识到 高度复杂的分析和计量能力 在当今的经济社会是多么重要 这就是为什么他们花 大量的时间和金钱 在孩子的教育上 中产阶级们也在加大教育投资 但在全球"教育军备竞赛"中 从幼儿园开始 到最终升入哈佛，斯坦福或麻省理工这样的顶尖大学 99%的平民阶层 越来越争不过那1%的特权子弟 结果就象经济学家艾伦 ・ 克鲁格 和迈尔斯.酷瑞克描绘的伟大的盖茨比曲线一样 随着收入失衡的增加 社会的流动性降低 财阀统治可能是任人为才 但你必须出生在权贵之家 否则连参加角逐的机会都没有 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
第三件事，也是我最担心的是 这股积极向上 同时推动全球富豪崛起的力量 正在挖空西方发达国家 的中产阶级 我们先谈谈技术 正在创造着亿万富翁的那股力量 也在吞食许多传统的中产阶级的工作机会 你最后一次使用旅行社是什么时候? 与工业革命相反 我们的新经济巨人 并]有创造很多新的就业机会 在其全盛时期，通用公司雇用数十万人 而Facebook 的雇员少于一万 全球化也正是如此 虽然它使数以百万计 的发展中国家人民脱离贫困 但它将西方国家中产阶级的工作机会 向海外外包 更可怕的现实是 没有任何经济规则 能自动使 经济增长 转变成广泛共享的繁荣 这体现了当今就我个人认为 最可怕的经济统计数据. 从九十年代后期，提高工作效率 与增加工资 和就业脱钩 这意味着，我们的国家越来越富有 企业效率增长 但没有创造更多就业机会 总体工资水平没有增加 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:00	<br><br>
	
综上所述,可以得到一个可怕的结论 那就是令人担扰的结构性失业 更令我担忧的是一个不同的噩梦般的场景 毕竟，在一个完全自由的劳动力市场里 几乎每个人都能找到工作 但我担心这反乌托邦社会 由发明了谷歌的天才 和其同党们统治 其他受雇于他们的只是打杂 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:30	<br><br>
	
所以当我为这一切沮丧之极时 我总用工业革命来安慰自己 毕竟，对于那些冷酷、魔鬼般的工厂 结果都还可以不是吗? 毕竟，我们现在都更富有、 更健康、更高大- 当然有几个例外 ― 我们比19 世纪初的祖先要长寿 但要切记 在我们学会 与社会大众 分享工业革命的硕果之前 我们不得不经历两个经济萧条 20 世纪 30 年代的大萧条 和19世纪70年代的长期萧条 两次世界大战 俄罗斯和中国的共产革命, 和西方社会 和政治极端动荡的时代 绝非巧合 现在我们也正在经历一个 社会和政治变革的时代 我们创建了现代福利国家 我们创建了公众教育 我们创建了公共卫生保障系统 我们创建了公共养老金 我们还创建了工会 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
今天，我们生活在一个 经济转型的时代, 其规模和范围 可与工业革命相提并论 要确保这一新经济造福天下 而不仅仅是使富豪们受益 我们需要非常 大胆的社会和政治变革 我们需要一个新政 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">Meet global corruption's hidden players </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
When the son of the president of a desperately poor country starts buying mansions and sportscars on an official monthly salary of $7,000, Charmian Gooch suggests, corruption is probably somewhere in the picture. In a blistering, eye-opening talk (and through several specific examples), she details how global corruption trackers follow the money ― to some surprisingly familiar faces. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
When we talk about corruption, there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs. Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them. Until his death in 2006, he was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian country rich in natural gas. Now, he really loved to issue presidential decrees. And one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother. He spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult, and his crowning glory was the building of a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital's central square and rotated to follow the sun. He was a slightly unusual guy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:00	<br><br>
	
And then there's that cliché, the African dictator or minister or official. There's Teodorín Obiang. So his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record. The vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that's on a par with that of Portugal. So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself a $30 million mansion in Malibu, California. I've been up to its front gates. I can tell you it's a magnificent spread. He bought an 18 million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, a stack of fabulous sports cars, some costing a million dollars apiece -- oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too. Now get this: Until recently, he was earning an official monthly salary of less than 7,000 dollars. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
And there's Dan Etete. Well, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria under President Abacha, and it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too. We've spent a great deal of time investigating a $1 billion -- that's right, a $1 billion ― oil deal that he was involved with, and what we found was pretty shocking, but more about that later. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
So it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there, carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we, personally, may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on. But does it just happen over there? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:54	<br><br>
	
Well, at 22, I was very lucky. My first job out of university was investigating the illegal trade in African ivory. And that's how my relationship with corruption really began. In 1993, with two friends who were colleagues, Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley, we set up an organization called Global Witness. Our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:24	<br><br>
	
So a few years later, and it's now 1997, and I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds. Perhaps you saw the film, the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond," the one with Leonardo DiCaprio. Well, some of that sprang from our work. Luanda, it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets, and a tiny, very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal. And it was a slightly crazy place. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:57	<br><br>
	
So I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed. But it wasn't about blood diamonds. Because I'd been speaking to lots of people there who, well, they talked about a different problem: that of a massive web of corruption on a global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing. And for what was then a very small organization of just a few people, trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge. And in the years that I've been, and we've all been campaigning and investigating, I've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global, massive scale possible, well it isn't just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase "weak governance." I mean, yes, it's all of those, but corruption, it's made possible by the actions of global facilitators. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:50	<br><br>
	
So let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier. Now, they're all people we've investigated, and they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone. Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up with high-end art and luxury houses without help. He did business with global banks. A bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him, one of which was used to buy the art, and American banks, well, they funneled 73 million dollars into the States, some of which was used to buy that California mansion. And he didn't do all of this in his own name either. He used shell companies. He used one to buy the property, and another, which was in somebody else's name, to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
And then there's Dan Etete. Well, when he was oil minister, he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that, guess what, yeah, he was the hidden owner of. Now, it was then much later traded on with the kind assistance of the Nigerian government -- now I have to be careful what I say here ― to subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni, two of the biggest oil companies around. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:05	<br><br>
	
So the reality is, is that the engine of corruption, well, it exists far beyond the shores of countries like Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan. This engine, well, it's driven by our international banking system, by the problem of anonymous shell companies, and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil, gas and mining operations, and, most of all, by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:36	<br><br>
	
Now let's take the banks first. Well, it's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money, but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too. For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia. Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent. So how did that happen? Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years. So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite, and the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry, and you can see that on YouTube, but it proved what we had long suspected, because it showed how the state's chief minister, despite his later denials, used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family. And HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled the region's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in Sarawak and elsewhere. The bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process, but it earned around 130 million dollars. Now shortly after our exposé, very shortly after our exposé earlier this year, the bank announced a policy review on this. And is this progress? Maybe, but we're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:14	<br><br>
	
And then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies. Well, we've all heard about what they are, I think, and we all know they're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society, also known as taxes. But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money, transformational sums of money, from poor countries. In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared, and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:55	<br><br>
	
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption. It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars. Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too. You see, shell companies, they're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
One striking recent case that we've investigated is how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo sold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands. So we spoke to sources in country, trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal. And we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies listed in London. Now, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan, they've calculated that Congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals. That's almost twice the country's annual health and education budget combined. And will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back? Well, the answer to that question, and who was really involved and what really happened, well that's going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:40	<br><br>
	
And how about the oil, gas and mining companies? Okay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them. Corruption in that sector, no surprise. There's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector? Well, because there's a lot at stake. In 2011, natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one. Now that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups, many of which haven't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:18	<br><br>
	
Now let's go back to the oil and mining companies, and let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal. And now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit because it's a very live issue, and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:35	<br><br>
	
Now, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward. Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni paid the Nigerian government for the block. The Nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount, to the very dollar, to an account earmarked for a shell company whose hidden owner was Etete. Now, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer. And here's the thing. After many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents, we found evidence that, in fact, Shell and Eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company, and frankly, it's hard to believe they didn't know who they were really dealing with there. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:21	<br><br>
	
Now, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went. I mean, these are state assets. They're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country. But in some countries, citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
And finally, well, there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable. It's just how some business is done. It's too complex and difficult to change. So in effect, what? We just accept it. But as a campaigner and investigator, I have a different view, because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum. In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems. In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea. But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency, and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law. Two thirds of the value of the world's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:46	<br><br>
	
So this is change happening. This is progress. But we're not there yet, by far. Because it really isn't about corruption somewhere over there, is it? In a globalized world, corruption is a truly globalized business, and one that needs global solutions, supported and pushed by us all, as global citizens, right here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:09	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
当我们谈论腐败时， 有几类典型的人会映入脑海。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
例如前苏联的自大狂。 萨帕尔穆拉特 ・ 尼亚佐夫(Saparmurat Niyazov)就是其中一个。 直至2006 年他去世之前， 他一直是土库曼斯坦最有权利的领袖， 这是一个中亚国家，天然气丰富。 他很爱颁布总统令。 其中之一是他曾经更改月份的名字 包括用他本人和他母亲的名字取而代之。 他花了数百万美元 建立了一个怪诞的个人崇拜， 他至高无上的荣耀是 为自己修建了一座40英尺高的镀金雕像 这个雕像傲然屹立于该国首都的中心广场 并能随太阳旋转。 他是个有点异常的人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:00	<br><br>
	
另一个就是老生常谈的人物， 被称为非洲的独裁者、部长或官员。 特奥多罗・奥比昂(Teodorin Obiang)。 他父亲是赤道几内亚的终身总统 这是一个西非国家， 自从1990 年代以来，已出口了数十亿美元的石油， 但该国也有着骇人听闻的人权记录。 绝大多数老百姓都 生活于非常悲惨的贫困中 尽管其人均收入相当于 葡萄牙。 小奥比昂(Obiang junior)给自己 在加利福尼亚州的马里布买了一栋3000万美元的豪宅。 我到过那豪宅的大门前。 可以说，那真是气势恢宏。 他买了价值1800 万欧元的艺术收藏品 该收藏品原属于时装设计师伊夫 ・ 圣洛朗(YSL)， 小奥比昂还有多辆豪华跑车， 有些车单价超过100 万美金 哦，他还有一驾湾流喷气机。 现在我们来看看： 直到最近，他官方的月薪 仅有不到7,000 美元。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
还有另一位丹・埃泰特(Dan Etete) 他是尼日利亚的前石油部长 隶属于阿巴查（Abacha）总统政府 丹・埃泰特也恰巧被定罪洗黑钱。 我们花了大量的时间 针对10亿美金― ― 是的，10 亿美金的一笔交易进行追查― ― 这是他所参与的石油交易的金额 结果非常令人震惊， 我们稍后再谈这个吧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
所以，我们很容易就下结论认为 腐败发生在那边， 被一群贪婪的专制统治者 和对国家无一益处的腐败者把持着 这些，对我们来说，可能是知之甚少的 感觉真得和自己没什么关系 而且我们也没受什么影响。 但腐败仅仅只发生在那边吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:54	<br><br>
	
在我22岁时，我非常幸运。 我大学毕业后的第一份工作 是调查非洲象牙非法贸易。 那是我参与反腐的开始。 1993 年，我与两个朋友，也是我同事， 西蒙 ・ 泰勒（Simon Taylor）和帕特里克・ 埃里(Patrick Alley) 一起成立了一个组织叫做“全球见证”(Global Witness)。 我们第一次行动就是调查 非法伐木在柬埔寨战争的资助方面所扮演的角色。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:24	<br><br>
	
几年后，1997 年， 我在安哥拉秘密调查血钻。 也许你看过 好莱坞电影"血钻"， 莱昂纳多 ・ 迪卡普里奥主演的。 电影的部分情节是根据我们的调查而来的。 罗安达，到处都是地雷受害者 他们在街上挣扎求生 战争孤儿生活在街道下的下水道中 极少部分富裕的精英们 在闲谈着到巴西和葡萄牙的购物之旅。 那是一个相当疯狂的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:57	<br><br>
	
所以我坐在一个非常闷热的酒店客房 感觉完全不知所措。 但这和血钻无关。 因为我和当地许多人都交流过 他们谈到另一个不同的问题： 在全球范围内一个巨大规模的腐败网 以及与石油相关的数以百万美金不知去向。 对于一个只有几个人 的组织来说， 试图思考我们怎样解决这个问题 真是一个巨大的挑战。 在这些年， 我们一直在行动和调查， 我一次又一次看到， 是什么让腐败在全球巨大的范围内发生， 这不仅仅是贪婪或权力滥用 或用含糊不清的"无能治理"可以解释的。 我的意思是，刚刚提到的都是原因， 但是腐败，之所以出现 是因为全球协调者的所作所为导致的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:50	<br><br>
	
所以让我们谈谈我之前提到过的那些人。 他们都是我们调查过的 而且他们不可能单独靠自己就能做出那些事的。 以小奥比昂（Obiang junior）为例。 没有协助的话，他是无法获得那些高端艺术品和豪宅的。 他与全球的银行有来往。 在巴黎的一家银行拥有由他控制的公司的帐户， 他就是用其中一个账号来购买艺术品的， 他和美国的银行也有来往， 令他把7300 万美金汇到了美国， 他用其中一些钱购买了加州豪宅。 而且他并不是用自己的名字行事的。 他用空壳公司。 他用一个空壳公司购买豪宅， 另一个在其他人名下， 用来支付豪宅生活所需的巨额账单。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
再有丹・埃泰特（Dan Etete）。 当他是石油部长的时候， 他将一块现在价值超过10 亿美金油田授予了一个公司 是的，你猜怎么着， 他是那公司的幕后老板。 现在，这公司 在尼日利亚政府的协助下 现在我得小心地在这里说 ― ― 它与壳牌石油公司和意大利埃尼石油公司的 子公司进行了交易， 这是那里最大的两家石油公司。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:05	<br><br>
	
因此事实是，这个腐败的引擎， 它远远不止只在这些国家存在 像赤道几内亚共和国，尼日利亚，或者土库曼斯坦。 这个引擎被驱动着， 这包括，我们的国际银行系统， 那些匿名的空壳公司， 和我们所给予的那些 大型石油、 天然气和采矿经营的隐秘的权利， 而且最重要的，还有我们的政客 他们无法兑现那些花言巧语， 也拿不出真正有意义的和系统性的行动来应对腐败。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:36	<br><br>
	
现在让我们先看看银行。 我要告诉你们银行会收脏钱 我想你们不会觉得惊讶。 但他们也用其他具有破坏性的方式优先处理他们的利润。 例如，在马来西亚沙捞越。 现在这个区域， 只有5 %的森林是完好无损。5%啊。 怎么会这样呢？ 因为一个精英和其主事者们 多年来， 一直支持伐木工业的规模化发展 来赚取数百万的美元。 所以我们派出卧底调查员 秘密地录下了与管理层成员的会议过程， 这段录影让有些人非常生气， 你可以在 youtube 上看到。 但它证明了我们长期以来的怀疑， 因为这段录影证实了这个州长， 尽管他后来加以否认， 通过他对土地和森林的许可证的控制 为自己和家人牟利。 汇丰银行（HSBC），好吧，我们知道汇丰银行 给该地区最大的几家伐木公司提供资金 对于这些公司在沙捞越和其他地方的破坏行为 汇丰银行脱不了干系。 汇丰违反了它自己的可持续发展政策， 但它赚了大约 1 亿 3000 万美金。 在我们曝光这件事不久， 就在我们今年早些时候曝光不久， 汇丰对外宣布关于这件事他们要重新审议公司政策。 这是进步吗？也许是， 但我们会对此案件 保持密切关注。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:14	<br><br>
	
然后我们看看匿名空壳公司的问题。 我想，我们都听说他们， 我们都知道一些人和一些公司 利用空壳公司来试图逃避 对社会应尽的责任， 也就是税。 但是，通常不为人知的是 如何利用空壳公司窃取庞大的金钱 大笔大笔的金钱被洗白之后 从贫穷的国家转出。 在我们调查过的几乎每一个腐败案件中， 都有空壳公司的参与， 而且，有时我们无法找出 谁真正参与了交易。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:55	<br><br>
	
最近世界银行有项研究 在200 例腐败案件中， 70%以上的案件 使用了匿名的空壳公司， 涉案金额总计达560 亿美元。 现在，许多这样的公司是在美国 或在英国， 在海外领土和英国皇家属地， 所以这并不仅仅是一个境外的问题， 这也发生在我们境内。 你看，空壳公司，他们是这些秘密交易的核心 这些交易可能使富裕精英们受益 但普通公民并未受益。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:28	<br><br>
	
我们最近调查了一个引人注目的案件 是刚果民主共和国的政府 如何将一系列的宝贵的国有矿业资产 卖给了英属维尔京群岛的空壳公司。 我们与刚果的线人谈话， 搜罗公司文件和其他信息， 尝试拼凑出这笔交易的真实模样。 我们都震惊地发现，这些空壳公司 快速地将许多资产转卖给了 在伦敦上市的大型国际矿业公司 以此赚取丰厚利润。 现在，由科菲 ・ 安南（Kofi Annan）领导的非洲进步小组（Africa Progress Panel）， 已经计算出刚果可能因这些交易损失了 超过13 亿美金。 这几乎是 该国每年的健康和教育预算总和的两倍。 那么刚果的人民，他们能把自己的钱拿回来吗？ 这个问题的答案， 谁真正参与了，以及到底发生了什么， 除非我们能采取些行动，否则这一切可能都将被封存在 英属维尔京群岛注册的神秘公司那里 和其他什么地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:40	<br><br>
	
那么，石油、 天然气和采矿公司又是怎样的？ 好吧，也许这有点老生常谈。 在这些产业发生贪腐一点都不奇怪。 到处都有贪腐，那么为什么要关注这些产业? 因为这里涉及很多利益。 2011 年，在非洲、 亚洲和拉丁美洲 天然资源的出口与援助资金的比例相差极为悬殊 几乎是19:1。 这严重损害了很多学校，大学， 医院和创业公司的利益， 他们根本得不到实际的资金支持而且也永远得不到 因为那些支援的经费已经被轻而易举地盗走了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:18	<br><br>
	
现在让我们回到石油和矿业公司， 让我们重新谈谈丹・埃泰特和那10 亿美金的交易。 现在请原谅我，我要照着纸条念， 因为这是一个现场的演说，我们的律师 查阅过相关的法律条文 所以他们希望我不要有任何口误。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:35	<br><br>
	
现在，表面上，这笔交易看来很简单。 壳牌和埃尼集团的子公司 付钱给尼日利亚政府购买了那块油田。 尼日利亚政府将收到的钱 以完全一样的金额，以美元的方式转给了 一个空壳公司的一个专用帐户 这公司背后的老板是埃泰特。 对这个被定罪的洗钱犯来说这笔交易可真不赖啊。 但现在的问题是 经过数月的挖掘 和对数百页法庭文件的阅读 我们发现了证据， 事实上，壳牌公司和埃尼集团早就知道这些资金 将被转到那个空壳公司， 坦白说，很难相信他们不知道 他们是真得在和谁做交易。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:21	<br><br>
	
而现在，不应该花费种种的努力 去找出这些交易的金钱去哪儿了。 我的意思是，这些都是国有资产。 他们本应该用于造福 这个国家的人民。 但在一些国家、 公民和记者 那些想曝光这些事情的人们 却被骚扰和逮捕 还有一些人甚至在冒生命危险去揭露真相。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
最后，有一些人他们相信 腐败是不可避免的。 他们认为这就是做生意的一种方式。 太复杂也太难改变了。 所以，后果是什么？我们只能接受它。 但作为一个活动者和调查员， 我有不同的看法， 因为我见过当一个想法汇聚了力量之后 会发生什么。 举例来说，在石油和采矿行业， 现在正开始实行 一个真正的全球的透明标准， 它可以解决这些问题。 在1999 年，当“全球见证”致电石油公司让他们 在交易付款实行透明化时， 好吧，有些人嘲笑我们 认为这是个极其天真的小点子。 但是，来自世界各地的 数以百计的公民社团集合起来 争取交易透明化， 现在它已经变成规范和法律了。 全球的石油和矿业公司的 三分之二的交易 现在都在接受交易透明化法规的规范。三分之二啊。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:46	<br><br>
	
所以，改变正在发生。 这就是进步。 但我们还远远没有达到目标。 因为它贪腐不是 只在那儿的某个地方发生，不是吗？ 在全球化的世界中， 贪腐是一个真正的全球化的生意， 它需要全球性的解决方案， 需要作为全球公民的我们，我们所有人 去支持和推动，就在这里。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:09	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">A tale of two political systems</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
It's a standard assumption in the West: As a society progresses, it eventually becomes a capitalist, multi-party democracy. Right? Eric X. Li, a Chinese investor and political scientist, begs to differ. In this provocative, boundary-pushing talk, he asks his audience to consider that there's more than one way to run a successful modern nation. A venture capitalist and political scientist, Eric X Li argues that the universality claim of Western democratic systems is going to be "morally challenged" by China.	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Good morning. My name is Eric Li, and I was born here. But no, I wasn't born there. This was where I was born: Shanghai, at the height of the Cultural Revolution. My grandmother tells me that she heard the sound of gunfire along with my first cries. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:32	<br><br>
	
When I was growing up, I was told a story that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity. It went like this. All human societies develop in linear progression, beginning with primitive society, then slave society, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and finally, guess where we end up? Communism! Sooner or later, all of humanity, regardless of culture, language, nationality, will arrive at this final stage of political and social development. The entire world's peoples will be unified in this paradise on Earth and live happily ever after. But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil, the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism, and the good shall triumph. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:24	<br><br>
	
That, of course, was the meta-narrative distilled from the theories of Karl Marx. And the Chinese bought it. We were taught that grand story day in and day out. It became part of us, and we believed in it. The story was a bestseller. About one third of the entire world's population lived under that meta-narrative. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
Then, the world changed overnight. As for me, disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth, I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:54	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
Now, as I was coming of age, something else happened. As if one big story wasn't enough, I was told another one. This one was just as grand. It also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end. This one went as follows: All societies, regardless of culture, be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian, must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units, and all these individuals are, by definition, rational, and they all want one thing: the vote. Because they are all rational, once given the vote, they produce good government and live happily ever after. Paradise on Earth, again. Sooner or later, electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples, with a free market to make them all rich. But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil. (Laughter) The good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe, sometimes by force, against the evil of those who do not hold elections. 	<br><br>

3:27	<br><br>
	
Eric X. Li: Now -- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:29	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:37	<br><br>
	
This story also became a bestseller. According to Freedom House, the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970 to 115 in 2010. In the last 20 years, Western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus: Multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long-suffering developing world. Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success. Those who do not are doomed to fail. But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:13	<br><br>
	
Fool me once ... 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:16	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
The rest is history. In just 30 years, China went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy. Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty. Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in China. In other words, all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single, one-party state did without voting. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps. Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point. Needless to say, I ate all my grandmother's portions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
So I asked myself, what's wrong with this picture? Here I am in my hometown, my business growing leaps and bounds. Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day. Middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history. Yet, according to the grand story, none of this should be happening. So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it. Yes, China is a one-party state run by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party, and they don't hold elections. Three assumptions are made by the dominant political theories of our time. Such a system is operationally rigid, politically closed, and morally illegitimate. Well, the assumptions are wrong. The opposites are true. Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one-party system. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
Now, most political scientists will tell us that a one-party system is inherently incapable of self-correction. It won't last long because it cannot adapt. Now here are the facts. In 64 years of running the largest country in the world, the range of the Party's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory, from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward, then privatization of farmland, then the Cultural Revolution, then Deng Xiaoping's market reform, then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople, something unimaginable during Mao's rule. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:38	<br><br>
	
So the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions. Institutionally, new rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions. For example, term limits. Political leaders used to retain their positions for life, and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules. Mao was the father of modern China, yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes. So the Party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
One thing we often hear is, "Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms," and "China is in dire need of political reform." But this claim is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias. See, some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see, and only such changes can be called political reform. The truth is, political reforms have never stopped. Compared with 30 years ago, 20 years, even 10 years ago, every aspect of Chinese society, how the country is governed, from the most local level to the highest center, are unrecognizable today. Now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind. Now I would venture to suggest the Party is the world's leading expert in political reform. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:56	<br><br>
	
The second assumption is that in a one-party state, power gets concentrated in the hands of the few, and bad governance and corruption follow. Indeed, corruption is a big problem, but let's first look at the larger context. Now, this may be counterintuitive to you. The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today. China's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members. In the most recent one, only five of them came from a background of privilege, so-called princelings. The other 20, including the president and the premier, came from entirely ordinary backgrounds. In the larger central committee of 300 or more, the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller. The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top. Compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries, I think you'll find the Party being near the top in upward mobility. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:53	<br><br>
	
The question then is, how could that be possible in a system run by one party? Now we come to a powerful political institution, little-known to Westerners: the Party's Organization Department. The department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations. It operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components: civil service, state-owned enterprises, and social organizations like a university or a community program. They form separate yet integrated career paths for Chinese officials. They recruit college grads into entry-level positions in all three tracks, and they start from the bottom, called "keyuan" [clerk]. Then they could get promoted through four increasingly elite ranks: fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu [deputy division manager], and chu [division manger]. Now these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay? It's serious business. The range of positions is wide, from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company. Once a year, the department reviews their performance. They interview their superiors, their peers, their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct. They conduct public opinion surveys. Then they promote the winners. Throughout their careers, these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks. Over time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels. There, they enter high officialdom. By that point, a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Just to show you how competitive the system is, in 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels, 600,000 fuchu and chu levels, and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:47	<br><br>
	
After the ju levels, the best few move further up several more ranks, and eventually make it to the Central Committee. The process takes two to three decades. Does patronage play a role? Yes, of course. But merit remains the fundamental driver. In essence, the Organization Department runs a modernized version of China's centuries-old mentoring system. China's new president, Xi Jinping, is the son of a former leader, which is very unusual, first of his kind to make the top job. Even for him, the career took 30 years. He started as a village manager, and by the time he entered the Politburo, he had managed areas with a total population of 150 million people and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:33	<br><br>
	
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay? This is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact. George W. Bush, remember him? This is not a put-down. (Laughter) Before becoming governor of Texas, or Barack Obama before running for president, could not make even a small county manager in China's system. Winston Churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest. Well, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:05	<br><br>
	
Now, Westerners always assume that multi-party election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:13	<br><br>
	
I was asked once, "The Party wasn't voted in by election. Where is the source of legitimacy?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:19	<br><br>
	
I said, "How about competency?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
We all know the facts. In 1949, when the Party took power, China was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression, average life expectancy at that time, 41 years old. Today, it's the second largest economy in the world, an industrial powerhouse, and its people live in increasing prosperity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:41	<br><br>
	
Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes, and here are the numbers in recent years. Satisfaction with the direction of the country: 85 percent. Those who think they're better off than five years ago: 70 percent. Those who expect the future to be better: a whopping 82 percent. Financial Times polls global youth attitudes, and these numbers, brand new, just came from last week. Ninety-three percent of China's Generation Y are optimistic about their country's future. Now, if this is not legitimacy, I'm not sure what is. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:19	<br><br>
	
In contrast, most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance. I don't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is, from Washington to European capitals. With a few exceptions, the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife. Governments get elected, and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election. Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret. At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy, not China's one-party system, that is in danger of losing legitimacy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:02	<br><br>
	
Now, I don't want to create the misimpression that China's hunky-dory, on the way to some kind of superpowerdom. The country faces enormous challenges. The social and economic problems that come with wrenching change like this are mind-boggling. Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues. On the political front, the worst problem is corruption. Corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy. But most analysts misdiagnose the disease. They say that corruption is the result of the one-party system, and therefore, in order to cure it, you have to do away with the entire system. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:39	<br><br>
	
But a more careful look would tell us otherwise. Transparency International ranks China between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries, and it's been moving up. India, the largest democracy in the world, 94 and dropping. For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China, more than half of them are electoral democracies. So if election is the panacea for corruption, how come these countries can't fix it? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:07	<br><br>
	
Now, I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets. It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions. So here they are. In the next 10 years, China will surpass the U.S. and become the largest economy in the world. Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries. Corruption will be curbed, but not eliminated, and China will move up 10 to 20 notches to above 60 in T.I. ranking. Economic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue, and the one-party system will hold firm. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:41	<br><br>
	
We live in the dusk of an era. Meta-narratives that make universal claims failed us in the 20th century and are failing us in the 21st. Meta-narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside. Now, I want to clarify something. I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy. On the contrary, I think democracy contributed to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world. It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system, the hubris, that is at the heart of the West's current ills. If they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others, and a little bit more on political reform at home, they might give their democracy a better chance. China's political model will never supplant electoral democracy, because unlike the latter, it doesn't pretend to be universal. It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely. The significance of China's example is not that it provides an alternative, but the demonstration that alternatives exist. Let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives. Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals, but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over. Let us stop telling people and our children there's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve. It is wrong. It is irresponsible. And worst of all, it is boring. Let universality make way for plurality. Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us. Are we brave enough to welcome it? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:26	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:42	<br><br>
	
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:45	<br><br>
	
Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay with me for a couple of minutes, because I want to ask you a couple of questions. I think many here, and in general in Western countries, would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional, but at the same time, many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that, without any form of oversight or consultation, decides what the national interest is. What is the mechanism in the Chinese model that allows people to say, actually, the national interest as you defined it is wrong? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:23	<br><br>
	
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist, called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism." It's not exactly right, but I think it comes close. So I know the largest public opinion survey company in China, okay? Do you know who their biggest client is? The Chinese government. Not just from the central government, the city government, the provincial government, to the most local neighborhood districts. They conduct surveys all the time. Are you happy with the garbage collection? Are you happy with the general direction of the country? So there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people. My point is, I think we should get unstuck from the thinking that there's only one political system -- election, election, election -- that could make it responsive. I'm not sure, actually, elections produce responsive government anymore in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:18	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:22	<br><br>
	
BG: Many seem to agree. One of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself. And you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in China. But then you've just mentioned other elements like, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course, a lot of other data that go in a different direction: tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental protests, etc. So you seem to suggest the Chinese model doesn't have a space outside of the Party for civil society to express itself. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:56	<br><br>
	
EXL: There's a vibrant civil society in China, whether it's environment or what-have-you. But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it. Because, by Western definitions, a so-called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system, but that concept is alien for Chinese culture. For thousands of years, you have civil society, yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order, and I think it's a big cultural difference. 	<br><br>

早上好. 我是李世默，我出生在这里。 不，其实不是。 这才是我出生时的上海。 当时，上海正处在“文化大革命”的高潮。 外婆后来告诉我，她当时抱着襁褓之中啼哭不止的我， 心惊胆战地听着“武斗”的枪声。 在我少年时，我被灌输了一个 关于人类社会发展规律的大故事， 这个故事是这样的 所有的人类社会都遵循一个线性的发展规律， 即从原始社会开始，经由奴隶社会、 封建社会、资本主义社会、社会主义社会， 最终过渡到, 猜猜这个终点？ 共产主义社会! 或早或晚, 所有的人类社会， 不管文化、语言、民族有何异同， 都将演进到这一 人类政治、社会发展的最高阶段 人类社会自此大同 在这人间天堂 永远过着幸福的生活. 但在实现这个目标之前，我们必须投身于 正义与邪恶的斗争, 即正义的社会主义与邪恶的资本主义之间的斗争, 正义终将胜利. 当然，这就是 从马克思主义理论提制出来的元叙事 这一元叙事在中国影响甚广. 我们从小就被反复灌输了这个宏大故事. 几乎融化到了血液之中，深信不笃。 这个元叙事到处畅销。 世界上曾经有整整三分之一的人 在它的笼罩之下生活. 然而，恍然一夜之间，世界沧桑巨变. 少年时期的信仰收挫折后， 我离国赴美，改宗成为伯克利的嬉皮士. (笑声) 就在我成年过程中，又发生了一件事. 仿佛我这辈子只经历那一个还不够似的。 我又被灌输了另一个宏大叙事. 这个元叙事的完美与早前的那一个不分伯仲. 它同样宣称，人类社会 遵循着一个线性的发展规律，指向一个终极目标. 故事是这样展开的： 所有的人类社会，不论其文化有何异同， 其民众是基督徒、穆斯林还是儒家信徒, 都将从传统社会过渡 到现代社会. 在传统社会中，最基本的社会单位是群体； 而在现代社会中，最基本的、神圣不可侵犯的社会单位是原子化的个人。 所有的个人都被认定为是理性的， 都有同一个诉求： 选举权. 因为每一个个人都是理性的，一旦有了权选举， 必然会选出好政府 随后过上永远幸福的生活 又是一个人间天堂. 选举民主制早晚将成为 所有国家和民族唯一的政治制度， 再加上一个自由放任的市场让他们发财. 但在实现这个目标之前，我们必须投身于 正义与邪恶的斗争. (笑声) 民主国家代表正义， 并肩负着 在全世界推动民主的使命, 有时甚至可以动用武力， 来打击那些不实行选举的邪恶势力. 乔治H.W.布什: 一个世界新次序… 乔治 W. 布什: ... 消灭世界上所有暴政... 奥巴马: ... 只有一个标准 衡量统治者. 李世默: 现在... (笑声) (掌声) 上述宏大叙事同样到处畅销. 根据“自由之家”的统计， 全世界采用选举民主制的国家，从1970年的45个 已增至2010年的115个. 近20多年来，西方的精英人士孜孜不倦地 在全世界奔走，推荐选举民主这一救世良方: 他们声称，实行多党制 和全民选举 是拯救 发展中国家于水火的唯一良药， 只要吃下它，就一定会实现繁荣. 否则，永无翻身之日. 但这一次，中国敬谢不敏。 被骗一次.... (笑声) 历史是最好的裁判. 仅仅30多年间，中国就从 世界上最贫困的农业国 一跃而为世界第二大经济体. 实现6.5亿人 脱贫。 这期间全世界80%的减贫成就 是由中国完成的。 也就是说，所有老的、新的民主国家 的脱贫人口加起来，都不及 中国一个零头, 而中国没有所谓的选举，也没有多党制. 看, 这是我小时候生活的必需品: 粮票. 上海一时每人每月的肉类定额 是300克. 不用说，我把外婆的份额全给吃了 所以，我禁不住问自己，我眼前画面到底哪里不对劲儿？ 我在一切今非昔比的故乡上海， 我自己的事业蒸蒸日上. 新生企业如雨后春笋般发展起来. 中产阶级以史无前例的 速度和规模在增长 但根据那个宏大叙事， 这一切景象本都不可能出现. 面对这一切，我开始做我唯一可以做的事，即研究它. 中国的确是个一党制的国家 由中国共产党长期执政， 不实行西方意义上的选举. 按照当代主流的政治理论 人们据此可以生成三个判断， 即这个制度一定是体制上僵化的、 政治上封闭的、道德上不具合法性的 但这些论断是错误的。 事实恰恰相反. 中国的一党制具有与时俱进的能力、选贤任能的体制、深植于民心的政权合法性， 这些是确保其成功的 三个核心要素。 大多数政治学家断言 一党制天生缺乏 自我纠错能力. 因此很难持久。 而事实却是. 中共已经在中国这个世界上最大的国家之一连续执政64年， 其政策调整的幅度 超过近代以来任何国家。 从激进的土改到“大跃进”运动， 再到土地“准私有化”, 从“文化大革命”, 到邓小平的市场化改革。 邓小平的继任者江泽民更进一步 主动吸纳包括民营企业家在内的新社会阶层人士入党， 而这在毛的时代是不可想象的。 事实证明，中共具有超凡的与时俱进和自我纠错能力。 过去实行的一些不再有效的制度 也不断得到纠正和更新. 比如，政治领导人的任期制. 以前，政治领导人实际上是终身任职的. 这容易导致大权独揽、 不受制约等问题. 毛泽东作为现代中国的缔造者， 在位晚年也未能避免犯下类似的严重错误 随后，中共逐步实施了领导人的任期制 并将任职的年龄上限确定为68到70岁。 最近很多人声称 相比于经济改革，中国的政治改革严重滞后 因此当前亟需在政改中取得突破. 这一论断实际上是隐藏着 政治偏见的话语陷阱. 这个话语陷进预设了 哪些变革才算所谓的政治改革， 只有实行这些特定的变革才算是政治改革. 事实上，中国的政治改革从未停滞. 与三十年、二十年，甚至十年前相比， 中国从基层到高层， 从社会各领域 到国家治理方式上， 都发生了翻天覆地的变化. 如果没有最根本性的政治改革 这一切变化都是不可能的. 我甚至想大胆地判断说 中共是全世界第一流的政治改革专家. 第二个西方主流的观点认为，一党制意味着 政治上封闭，一小撮人把持了权力， 必然导致劣政和腐败. 的确，腐败是一个大问题. 不过，让我们先打开视野看一下全景. 说起来可能令人难以置信. 中共内部选贤任能竞争之激烈程度 可能超过世界上所有的政治组织. 十八大前，中共的最高领导机构――中央政治局共有25名委员. 其中只有5人 出身背景优越，也就是所谓的“太子党”. 其余20人，包括国家主席和政府总理， 都是平民出身. 再看300多人组成的十七届中央委员会， 出身显赫者的 比例更低. 可以说，绝大多数中共高层领导人 都是靠自身努力和激烈竞争获得晋升的. 与其他发达国家和发展中国家 统治精英的出身相比， 我们必须承认中共内部平民出身的干部 享有广阔的晋升空间. 问题是, 中共如何 在一党制的基础上保证选贤任能呢？ 关键之一是有一个强有力的组织机构， 对此西方鲜有人知: 即中共的组织部. 组织部运作一套 选贤任能的机制 恐怕最成功的商业公司都会自叹弗如. 它像一个旋转的金字塔 有三个组成部分: 即政府职能部门、国有企业， 以及政府管辖的事业单位，如大学、 社区组织等. 公务人员既可以在某一类部门中长期工作 也可以在三类中交替任职. 政府以及相关机构从大学毕业生中招录人员 大部分新人会从最低一级的 科员干起。 组织部门会根据其表现，决定是否将其提升 到更高的四个管理职位上: 副科、科、副处、处。 这可不是电影《龙威小子》中的动作名称， 而是严肃的人事工作。 这一区间的职位包罗万象， 既可以负责贫困农村的卫生工作 也可能负责城区里的招商引资。 或一个企业的管理人员. 各级干部每年都要接受组织部门的考察. 其中包括征求上级、下级和同事的反馈意见， 以及个人操守审查. 此外还有民意调查. 最终择优提职. 在整个职业生涯中，干部们 在这三大领域内轮转任职. 在基层表现优秀的佼佼者 可以晋升为副局和正局级干部. 进入高级干部行列. 这一级别的干部，有可能 领导数百万人口的城区， 也有可能管理年营业收入数亿美元的国有企业. 从统计数据就可以看出选拔局级干部的竞争有多激烈， 2012年，中国科级与副科级干部约为90万人， 处级与副处级干部约为60万人， 而局级与副局级干部仅为4万人. 在局级干部中， 最为出众的极少数人才有机会继续晋升， 238 最终进入中共中央委员会。 一个晋升到高层的干部，职业生涯要经过二三十年的历练. 这过程中有任人唯亲的问题吗，当然有. 但从根本上，干部是否德才兼备才是提拔的决定性因素。 事实上，中华帝国的官僚体系有着千年历史， 今天中共的组织部门创造性地继承了这一独特的历史遗产， 并发展成现代化的制度以培养当代中国的政治精英. 新任国家主席习近平的履历就是非常鲜明的例证. 习的父亲确实是中共的一位前领导人，这很不寻常, 他是第一个前领导人后代当上最高领导的. 但他的仕途也历经了30年之久 习近平从村干部做起， 一步一个脚印的走到今天这个岗位。在他进入中央政治局之前， 他领导过的地区总人口累计 已超过1.5亿 创造的GDP合计超过1.5万亿美元. 千万不要误解， 这不是针对具体的人，仅仅是事实的陈述. 如果要论政府管理经验，小布什, 记得他吗? 这不是看不起任何人. (笑声) 在任德州州长前, 和奥巴马第一次问鼎美国总统时， 他们资历还比不上 中国一个小县长 温斯顿・丘吉尔曾说： “民主是个坏制度，但其他制度更坏”。 可惜，他没有见识过组织部. 西方人总认为 多党竞选和普选 是合法性的唯一来源. 曾有人问我：“中共不经选举执政. 其合法性从何而来？” 我的回答是：“舍我其谁的执政能力.” 我们都知道历史. 1949年中共执政时， 中国战火肆虐，外敌横行，国土四分五裂，满目疮痍, 中国人的人均寿命仅为41岁。 但在今天，中国已跻身世界第二大经济体， 一个工业大国，人民生活 迅速改善。 根据皮尤研究中心在中国的民意调查报告， 其中一些数据反映了中国的主流民意： 85%的中国民众，对国家未来方向表示满意. 民众认为过去五年生活得到改善的比例 70% 对未来颇感乐观的民众比例, 压倒性的82% 《金融时报》全球青年民调结果 刚刚公布的数据显示. 93%的中国90后年轻人 对国家的未来感到乐观。 如果这不是合法性，那我就不知道到底什么才是合法性了。 相比之下，全世界大部分选举民主制国家 都处于惨淡经营的境况。 关于美国和欧洲的政治困境， 在座的听众都了然于胸，无需我再详述。 除了极少数例外，大部分 采用选举的发展中国家 迄今为止还在遭受贫困和战火的折磨。 政府通过选举上台后，其支持率在几个月内就会跌到 50%以下 从此一蹶不振甚至持续走低，直到下一次选举. 民主正陷入“一次选举，长期后悔”的周期性怪圈. 的周期性怪圈. 这样下去，失去合法性的 恐怕不是中国的一党制， 而是选举民主制. 当然，我不想造成一种误会 认为中国成为超级大国 已经指日可待了. 中国当前面临巨大挑战. 巨大变迁带来的经济、社会问题数不胜数 譬如环境污染， 食品安全、人口问题. 在政治领域，最大的挑战是腐败. 目前，腐败依然猖獗，危及中国的政治制度 及其道德合法性. 但是，很多分析人士误判了腐败的原因. 他们声称腐败是一党制导致的， 只有终结一党制 才能根绝腐败. 更严谨一点儿的分析将证明这种观点毫无根据. 据透明国际发布的全球清廉指数排名， 在近170个国家里, 中国近年来的排名在第70到80名之间， 且呈逐年上升之势. 印度是世界上人口最多的选举民主制国家， 排名第94位，且逐年下滑； 排名在中国后的约100个国家中， 超过一半是选举民主制国家. 如果民主是根治腐败的万灵药， 为何在这么多国家不灵呢？ 我是搞风险投资的，长于预测。 因此，不做几个预测就结束今天的演讲 似乎不妥. 下面是我的预测. 未来十年, 中国将超过美国 成为世界第一大经济体. 按人均收入计算也将 在发展中国家中名列前茅. 腐败虽然无法根绝，但将得到有效控制. 在透明国际的全球清廉指数排行榜上，中国有望继续提升10到20名 跨入全球最清廉的前60国之列. 经济改革会加速实施，政治改革也将继续推进， 中共一党执政将稳固持续. 我们正在见证一个时代的落幕. 在20世纪，我们见证了一个元叙事 因极端教条而失败 21世纪的元叙事正重蹈同样的覆辙. 元叙事就像癌症一样 正在从内部吞噬民主. 我想澄清一下. 我并不是要谴责民主. 相反，我认为民主 对西方的崛起和现代世界的诞生居功至伟. 然而，很多西方精英 把某一种民主形式模式化、普世化， 他们的傲慢, 是西方当前各种病症的病灶所在 如果西方的精英不是把大把的时间 花在向外国推销民主上， 而是更多关心一下自身的政治改革， 恐怕民主还不至于像今天这样无望. 中国的政治模式不可能取代 选举民主, 因为中国从不将自己的政治制度 包装成普世通用的模式. 也从不热衷于对外输出。但这正是关键所在. 中国模式的重要意义 不在于为世界各国提供了一个可以替代选举民主的新模式 而在于从实践上证明了良政的模式不是单一而是多元的，各国都能找到适合本国的政治制度。 让我们为元叙事的时代画个句号吧。 共产主义和民主可能都是人类美好的追求， 但它们普世化的教条时代已经过去。 我们的下一代，不需要被灌输说 世界上只有一种政治模式 所有社会 都只有一种归宿。 这是错误的，不负责任的 更是乏味的。 让世界给多元模式生存的空间吧. 也许一个更精彩的时代正缓缓拉开帷幕. 我们有没有勇气拥抱它呢？ 谢谢. (鼓掌) 谢谢.谢谢.谢谢.谢谢. 主持人: 世默, 等几分钟, 我要问你几个问题. 我想很多在座的西方人 会同意你多民主制度 功能失败的分析, 但是同时他们会对 一个不是被选举产生 的政权, 没有任何监督和协商, 去决定国家利益表示怀疑. 中国政治模式里有什么机制 可以让人民 说政权所定义的国际利益是错的? 政治学者福山 曾经把中国的制度称为”响应民意的威权.” 这不完全精确,但相差不远. 我知道中国最大的民意 调查公司. 你知道他们最大的客户是谁吗? 中国政府. 不只是中央政府, 市级省级政府, 最小的地方政府. 他们经常进行民意调查. 你们对收垃圾等市政服务满意吗? 你们对国家的大方向满意吗? 所以,中国有一个很不同的机制 能够去响应人民的诉求. 我要说的关键是, 我们应该从 只有一种有效政治制度的思想中解放出来, 只有选举,选举,选举, 才能产生响应民意的政府. 其实,我不觉得当今世界的选举 能够产生响应民意的政府. (鼓掌) 主持人: 很多人认为, 民主制度的一个功能 是让公民社会能够表达自己. 你举出数据论证 中国政府拥有民众的支持. 但你也讲到其他因素 譬如, 巨大的挑战, 当然, 还有其他数据显示另外一个方向: 上万的抗议和群体事件 环保问题等等. 你是否建议中国模式 不允许在中共以外 有公民社会的空间? 李世默: 中国有着相当活跃的公民社会, 环保组织等等. 但他们不一样,你可能认不出来. 在西方政治学定义里, 公民社会 必须存在与政治体制之外 甚至对立于政治体制, 但这个思路与中国文化格格不入. 数千年来在中国,所谓的公民社会都有存在 但它们与政治体制 相辅相成, 我认为 这是一个很大的文化差异. 主持人: 感谢你与TED分享这些思想. 李世默: 谢谢你. 	<br><br>

从全球政治学视野看中共与改革 	<br><br>
	
大家下午好，很开心来清华和同学们交流。我不是老师，我是生意人，但赚钱以外，我的业余爱好是研究中国共产党。首先，我要声明我不是中国共产党党员，小时候试过，但可能因为生活作风有问题，被拒绝了（笑）。后来入党未成，一不小心当上了资本家。我平时是周一到周五做资本家，周六周日研究中国共产党。今天我跟大家分享我这些年研究中共的一点――不能说是学问――只是一些心得，希望大家能够对我的心得提出意见和批判。 	<br><br>
	
我要讲的题目是《从全球政治学视野看中国共产党与改革》。政治学，英语叫political science，就是政治科学，但政治学是一门软科学，就是用科学的方式来研究社会，研究政治，研究软的东西。 	<br><br>
	
那么科学的方式是什么呢？一般的科学方式是：第一步是要设立一个假定，拿这个假定到实验室里去验证，有的假定被验证出是对的，有的假定被验证出是错的。验证了对的假定可能成为理论。过一段时间又有人有新的假定，新的假定被验证以后就推翻以前的理论，成为新的理论。科学就是这样发展的。我今天讲的所有内容都只是假定。 	<br><br>
	
今天的假定是：全世界都需要改革。 	<br><br>
	
21世纪是一个在改革中竞争的时代。能成功改革的国家将是赢家，改革失败的国家将是输家。 	<br><br>
	
在这场改革竞争中，中国共产党领导的中国将在全球大国中脱颖而出。 	<br><br>
	
所以，21世纪是中国的世纪。 	<br><br>
	
全世界几乎所有国家都面临治理危机，从发达国家到发展中国家，都在说“我们需要改革，不改革不行了”。可是几乎在所有国家，改革都陷入了巨大的困境，举步维艰，四面楚歌，为什么？ 	<br><br>
	
我想借用五位世界一流的政治学学者的眼光来讲这个题目。 	<br><br>
塞缪尔・亨廷顿：政治衰败 	<br><br>
	
 	
	
塞缪尔・亨廷顿《变化社会中的政治秩序》 	<br><br>
	
第一位叫塞缪尔・亨廷顿，大家都知道他写的《文明的冲突与世界秩序的重建》，但在政治学里我觉得他最好的著作是《变化社会中的政治秩序》。亨廷顿发明了一个概念叫“政治衰败”（political decay），这是近代政治学里很重要的一个概念。 	<br><br>
	
亨廷顿在《变化社会中的政治秩序》里研究了二战以后新独立的国家，这些国家的大环境在发生巨大的变迁，可是他们的政治制度不能相应地改变，去适应新的环境。这种情况下，就发生了政治衰败。他还说在体制很稳定、很成功的情况下也会发生政治衰败。意思就是说，现有政治体制发生了所谓的固化，固化到一定程度，环境发生了变化，社会发生了变化，世界变了，可是政治体制没有办法去推动质的变化来适应外部环境和社会内在的变化，那么这个政治体制就发生了政治衰败。 	<br><br>
	
曼瑟尔・奥尔森：分利联盟 	<br><br>
第二位叫曼瑟尔・奥尔森，他的代表作是《国家兴衰探源》。他创造的概念叫“分利联盟”（distributive coalition）。 	<br><br>
	
奥尔森在《国家兴衰探源》里研究民主体制，他说民主体制里边必然出现利益集团，这些利益集团通过多年不断积累权力，形成分利联盟。意思就是利益集团权力强大到一定程度，他们可以寻租，他们可以俘获甚至操控政治体制，使政治体制为分利联盟的利益服务，而不是为整体利益服务，甚至以损害整体利益为代价来维护分利联盟的利益。奥尔森说在民主体制里，分利联盟俘获政治体制这个问题是一个无解的困境。只有两种东西可以打破这个困境，一个是革命，一个是外部的冲击。如战争。这是非常悲观的一个角度，无解。 	<br><br>
	
弗朗西斯・福山：否决制 	<br><br>
弗朗西斯・福山《政治秩序的起源》、《政治秩序和政治衰败》 	<br><br>
	
第三位叫弗朗西斯・福山，最近两本书叫《政治秩序的起源》与《政治秩序和政治衰败》。福山把前两个人所创造的概念――“政治衰败”和“分利联盟”――组合起来讨论政治衰败。 	<br><br>
	
第一，他说政治衰败在任何政治体制内部都可能发生，无论是威权体制还是民主体制。福山说，现代治理需要三大要素：一是强政府，二是法治，三是民主问责。 	<br><br>
	
福山说美国现在正处于政治衰败中，原因之一是当代美国是强法治、强民主、弱政府。而这个局面使得美国无法推进急需的改革。 	<br><br>
	
福山还提到两种问责制，一种叫自下而上的问责制，一种叫自上而下的问责制，两种制度各有优劣。 	<br><br>
	
自下而上的问责制即通常说的民主制度，你不好老百姓把你选下去。它的优势在于有一个自动回应机制，你做的不好老百姓可以选另外一位。它的劣势在于分利联盟，福山又创造了一个新词叫“否决制”――“Vetocracy”，就是分利联盟把持政治体制，为了维护自己的利益，损害集体的利益。“Vetocracy”其实就是中国人说的，成事不足败事有余。自上而下的问责制，也许中国是自上而下的问责制，私人企业也是自上而下的问责制，它有强大的执行力，这来自于政治独立性，就是福山说的“political autonomy”。它的困境和弊端，第一是信息的困境，底下的人不把正确的信息给老板，老板摸不清楚下面到底怎么回事，导致决策错误。第二是福山说的所谓的“坏皇帝”的风险，老板出问题了怎么办？ 	<br><br>
	
福山说改革在美国正在失败，美国没有办法改革。为什么？他举了一些原因。 	<br><br>
	
第一，民主和透明成了美国改革的绊脚石。美国太多的公众参与，太多的透明，也就是说太多的民主，使这个国家的改革寸步难行。 	<br><br>
	
第二，公民社会在某种程度上也不利于美国的改革。公民社会孵化了利益集团的形成，利益集团积累权力形成分利联盟，分利联盟导致否决制。在这样的公民社会里，只要有一个分利联盟不喜欢一件事，它就能把这件事给黄了。要所有人都觉得没问题才能做，结果是什么事都做不成，改革更做不成。 	<br><br>
	
第三，是法治。美国的法治出现了治理的司法化。就是说所有的政治、所有治理都要通过立法。立法的过程遭到分利联盟的俘获，即便立了法，分利联盟再通过司法程序百般阻挠它的执行。 	<br><br>
	
最后，是自由。福山说自由和特权是一步之遥，一不小心自由就变成了特权。美国最高法院今年判决说政治献金没有上限，这是宪法说的言论自由。就是说我自己合法赚来的钱，为什么不能在电视上买广告，说某某政客好，说哪些政策好，哪些政策不好？给政治献金设上限是违反言论自由的。而维护言论自由的后果是什么呢？当然是越有钱越牛，所以自由与特权是一步之遥。 	<br><br>

王绍光、 甘阳	<br><br>
王绍光《中国式共识型决策》 	<br><br>
	
第四位政治学学者，是王绍光，他是香港中文大学的教授。他研究国家能力和国家建设。他近期的著作叫《中国式共识型决策》。王老师用中国在2009年启动的医保改革为案例，仔细阐述了当代中国的政治体制如何超越利益集团，成功推动改革。 	<br><br>
	
中国治理模式的三大要素 	<br><br>
	
我认为中国的治理模式有三大核心要素。 	<br><br>
	
一是贤能治理。这是理想状态，贤能治理也会出问题。中国选贤任能的模式，就是中国的官员来自于草根，最有能耐的人通过这个体系一步步往上爬，最终进入中国的最高治理阶层。 	<br><br>
二是实验治理。中国几十年来推行很多政策，都是从小地方先试起来。失败了就算了。成功了就让各个地方学，再成功了就全国推广。失败的成本较低。这样的实验治理只能在中央集权的国家才能实现，在美国不可能，你在旧金山实验一个东西成了，然后华盛顿让麻省也试，做不到的。 	<br><br>
	
三是回应治理。有没有能力回应人民的需求，回应制度到底健康不健康。据我了解，中共其实有非常复杂和有效及时的反应机制。 	<br><br>
	
三中全会是政治改革的又一个里程碑 	<br><br>
中国30多年的改革开放，取得巨大的成就，也面临巨大挑战。 	<br><br>
	
经济挑战非常严峻，中国经济模式走到现在创造了巨大的财富，但这个模式要改。环境变了，经济结构变了，所以要改变这个经济结构，可是在改变过程中增长率就会下降，又会引发其他问题。这个平衡怎么掌握，很难。 	<br><br>
	
腐败是一个巨大的挑战。环境也是巨大的挑战。这么大规模，这么快速工业化，人类历史上前所未有，造成的环境问题是巨大的。 	<br><br>
	
三中全会好像有600多条改革的政策，国企改革、土地改革、法律改革、经济改革。三中全会开完后，很多学者、媒体都说中国开始实施大胆的经济改革，可是政治改革停滞不前甚至开倒车。我觉得这是一个误读。 	<br><br>
	
我觉得三中全会启动了中国几十年来最大胆的政治改革。很多人把政治改革的定义定死了，认为只有往某种方向去改变的政策才叫政治改革，朝其他方向作的改变，再巨大也不叫政治改革。但如果把政治改革作为一个中性词，就是对政治体制动刀，对政治体制做质的改变，我想三中全会是一个里程碑。 	<br><br>
	
为什么是里程碑？我认为有三方面。 	<br><br>
	
一是中央和地方政府权力分配发生了巨大变化。三中全会比较重要的一点就是国家预算，以前中国的国家税收只有一半在中央政府手里，这次把它变成了全国的预算，这是巨大的权力再分配。 	<br><br>
	
二是党纪和国法的权力分配发生了巨大变化。三中全会对中纪委进行了重组，把地方纪委的决策权力从地方党委那里抽出来。这又是一个巨大的权力再分配。 	<br><br>
	
三是党和国家的关系发生了巨大变化。1949年建国时引进的苏联模式“三驾马车”――人大对应最高苏维埃、党中央对应苏共党中央、国务院对应苏联的部长联席会。三中全会――我认为――把三驾马车的格局打破了。国家成立了很多领导小组和委员会，都是党中央在领导。比如，中央国家安全委员会，负责国内国外的安全；深化改革领导小组，负责经济改革政策。这是一个惊人的权力再分配，是一个巨大的政治改革。中国共产党走到了中国国家治理的前台中央。 	<br><br>
	
所以，我觉得三中全会是中国改革历程中一个巨大的里程碑，很多人把新中国的60多年分成两个30年，我觉得三中全会启动了第三个30年。第三个30年最重要的两个方向：一是政治治理的完善，一是全方位民族复兴。 	<br><br>
	
中国政治体制改革的原动力 	<br><br>
	
近些年来，政治学里流行的说法是，选举民主制国家最善于自我纠正，也就是改革，因为能够通过选举更换执政党。但是现实却恰恰相反。民主国家普遍陷入治理危机和改革困境。而中国呢？ 	<br><br>
	
回顾中华人民共和国的65年历史，在中共的一党领导下，中国经历的政治、经济变革，幅度和深度是近代史上罕见的，远远超出几乎所有其他国家，包括所有民主选举制的国家。为什么？我认为这是中国政治体制的独特性质的结果。在中国，核心是中国共产党，中共本身就是中国的政治体制。中国是世界上大国中唯一的一个拥有这么一个独立于社会又同时来自于社会的政治力量，正如福山所说的，political autonomy。中共来自于中国社会的草根，又高于中国社会的所有利益集团，这个机制就是中国改革的原动力。 	<br><br>

第五位是一位古人，这位古人是政治学的泰斗，没有他就没有政治学，他叫尼可罗・马基雅维利，是500年前佛洛伦萨共和国的外交长官。美第奇家族复辟以后，把他打入监狱，施以酷刑，然后将他流放到乡村。在写给友人弗兰西斯科・维托里的信中，马基雅维利讲述了自己的流放生活。在漫长而平静的日子里，每当夜深人静的时候，马基雅维利总会换上宫廷的华服，进入自己的书房。在那里，他废寝忘食地阅读先哲遗篇，与古贤心照神交。只有在那样的漫漫长夜里，他才感觉不到饥饿干渴，也不再惧怕死亡。在那里，他写下了流传百世的代表作《论李维》，这本书是所有政治学的基石。 	<br><br>
	
他在这本书里，把全世界所有政治制度归纳成三种：一是君主制；一是贵族制，他说的贵族制是希腊语的贵族，就是我们讲的选贤任能或贤能制，不是后来欧洲出现的世袭制的贵族；三是民主制。 	<br><br>
	
他说每一种政治制度都能够表现得非常好，可是每一种政治制度都有它衰败的一面。君主制会衰败成暴政，贵族制会衰败成寡头制，民主制会衰败成放荡制。 	<br><br>
	
我想留给大家的一个想法，就是也许世界上没有永远的东西。我们研究政治学，研究任何一个国家的政治体制，最值得研究的就是这个政治体制在它的生命周期里，是在哪个点上。如果在少年期那是一种预测，如果在中年期和老年期就是另一种预测。在现实中，也许没有一个政治体制是永恒的。每一个政治体制，不管是君主制也好，贵族制也好，民主制也好――中国现在实行的也许是贤能制，美国是民主制――所有这些政治体制最终都可能走向衰败，就像人的身体一样。政治学的基础就是，把政治体制、社会当人的身体一样研究。把政治体制比作人的身体，就像人小时候经常生病，每年都感冒，病历卡很厚，但是一到发育的时候什么病都没有了，到七八十岁病又回来了，也就临近死亡了。 	<br><br>
	
我经常把当代中国比作美国100多年前，100多年前的美国也在发生巨大的变革，快速地工业化，那个时候的美国，它的腐败、它的暴力远远超过今天的中国，但那个时候的美国，它的政治体制在它的少年期，那些再严重的问题也没能阻挡它成为超级大国。中国的政治体制也有很多问题。每个人身体里边都有癌细胞，就看它什么时候出来。每个政治体制的基因里边也有癌细胞。我的假定是，中国的政治体制在少年期。美国政治体制，以及整个西方的政治体制，倒是一个值得研究的问题，它们肯定不处在少年期。我们要研究的问题就是西方发达国家的政治体制，在它们的生命周期里边是中年期还是晚年期？如果美国的政治体制是一个50岁的人，它还有一次机会可以重新复兴。如果是80岁呢，就像福山讲的那样，政治衰败就是眼前的宿命。 	<br><br>
	
中国的政治体制处在少年期，它具有巨大的活力――也就是改革的能力，21世纪是中国的世纪。 	<br><br>

李世默21日在清华大学演讲 学生、校友争看TED演讲“真人版” 600人会场被挤爆	<br><br>
	
	
	
发表时间：2014-12-21	<br><br>
12月21日下午3时，应清华大学时事大讲堂邀请，TED视频演讲名人、上海春秋研究院研究员李世默来到清华建筑学院报告厅，以“从全球政治学新视野看中国共产党与改革”为题，做一小时演讲，然后和在场听众进行了长时间互动。	<br><br>
	
开场前两小时，十余名师生入场占座；开场前1小时，1/4座位上有听众。2点50分，六百座报告厅座无虚席，场外尚有大量校外听众等待。演讲时，过道上挤满了听众，许多未能入场的听众在侧门外旁听，为此不得不打开侧门。 	<br><br>
	
李世默首先自我介绍――非党员，曾经被党组织拒绝，职业是风险投资，但业余爱好是研究政治学：“周一到周五，我努力赚钱，周六周日我浪费时间去研究政治，研究中国共产党”。 	<br><br>
	
随后，李世默提出了自己对世界形势的判断――改革年代，从欧洲的经济停滞、美国的社会困境说起，指出改革是全世界的大趋势，而不仅仅是中国的特征。谈到美国困境的时候，他提到了和70多岁加州州长的对话：“西海岸高铁并不是我的项目，是我父亲的，他六十年代当州长的时候就打算这样做……”。李世默指出，虽然高铁仍然没有动工，但已经有200多个起诉在等待这个项目了，所谓的法制、分权缚住了美国的手脚。 	<br><br>
李世默引用了诸多政治学者，包括福山的言论，指出西方政治结构的衰落已是一个共识。话题随后回到中国自身。李世默首先回顾了中国改革史――从建国开始，指出改革贯穿了新中国的整个历史。而最近的改革则明显增强了中央政府的威权，社会因此走进快车道。医保覆盖率在数年内从20%增长到100%就是明证：“外国人写文章，说我们动不了利益集团。过了几年我再看，发现它们列举的利益集团头目大多已经被抓走了”。李世默因此对中国改革充满信心，对中国压倒西方充满信心。 	<br><br>
	
在演讲前，李世默已经承诺听众：“请随意提问题，不必局限于演讲内容” 	<br><br>
	
有人问研究政治学是否有利于赚钱。李世默分享了自己的经验：“不，这对赚钱来说不是好事。投资考虑短线，许多人准确地判断了宏观经济，但依然亏的一塌糊涂”。 	<br><br>
	
还有听众问西方是否有革命的可能。李世默同样借西方学者之口做了回答：“能革命算是好结果，但更可能是慢慢地死去，死很久”。 	<br><br>
	
一名男生向李世默请教A股的投资前景。李世默回答说A股被低估已经很久了，许多企业的分公司在香港的市值都高于总公司。但他无法指出哪些具体股票值得购入。 	<br><br>
	
最后一个问题和教育改革相关，李世默做答后反问听众：“如果大学改成自主招生，在座的各位，还有把握来到清华园吗？”。听众席鸦雀无声。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">How to reduce poverty? Fix homes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In 1985, architect Paul Pholeros was challenged by the director of an Aboriginal-controlled health service to "stop people getting sick" in a small indigenous community in south Australia. The key insights: think beyond medicine and fix the local environment. In this sparky, interactive talk, Pholeros describes projects undertaken by Healthabitat, the organization he now runs to help reduce poverty―through practical design fixes―in Australia and beyond. 	<br><br>

The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal. I don't think anyone in this room would disagree. What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars use the words, it all just sounds so, so simple. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:37	<br><br>
	
Now, I've got no bucket of money today and I've got no policy to release, and I certainly haven't got a guitar. I'll leave that to others. But I do have an idea, and that idea is called Housing for Health. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
Housing For Health works with poor people. It works in the places where they live, and the work is done to improve their health. Over the last 28 years, this tough, grinding, dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia, and more recently overseas, and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments. It can improve health, and it can play a part in reducing, if not eliminating, poverty. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:32	<br><br>
	
I'm going to start where the story began, 1985, in central Australia. A man called Yami Lester, an Aboriginal man, was running a health service. Eighty percent of what walked in the door, in terms of illness, was infectious disease -- third world, developing world infectious disease, caused by a poor living environment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:57	<br><br>
	
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs. He got a medical doctor. He got an environmental health guy. And he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project. Yami told us at that first meeting, there's no money. Always a good start, no money. You have six months. And I want you to start on a project which in his language he called "uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku," which, translated, is "a plan to stop people getting sick," a profound brief. That was our task. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:41	<br><br>
	
First step, the medical doctor went away for about six months, and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals, what were we aiming at. After six months of work, he came to my office and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:00	<br><br>
	
[Washing, clothes, wastewater, nutrition... ] 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
Now, I was very, very unimpressed. Come on. Big ideas need big words and preferably a lot of them. This didn't fit the bill. What I didn't see and what you can't see is that he'd assembled thousands of pages of local, national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:31	<br><br>
	
The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason. The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate, so the story had to be told in pictures of what were these goals. We work with the community, not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn't understand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:52	<br><br>
	
So we had the goals, and each one of these goals -- and I won't go through them all ― puts at the center the person and their health issue, and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good. And the highest priority, you see on the screen, is washing people once a day, particularly children. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:17	<br><br>
	
Now I hope most of you are thinking, "What? That sounds simple." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
Now, I'm going to ask you all a very personal question. This morning before you came, who could have had a wash using a shower? I'm not going to ask if you had a shower, because I'm too polite. That's it. (Laughter) Okay. All right. I think it's fair to say, most people here could have had a shower this morning. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:41	<br><br>
	
I'm going to ask you to do some more work. I want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen. I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head. Have you all got a house? I'm going to ask you to live there for a few months, so make sure you've got it right. It's in the northwest of Western Australia, very pleasant place. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
Okay. Let's see if your shower in that house is working. I hear some "aw"s and I hear some "aah." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:09	<br><br>
	
If you get a green tick, your shower's working. You and your kids are fine. If you get a red cross, well, I've looked carefully around the room and it's not going to make much difference to this crew. Why? Because you're all too old. And I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you, but you are. Now before you get offended and leave, I've got to say that being too old in this case means that pretty much everyone in the room, I think, is over five years of age. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:38	<br><br>
	
We're really concerned with kids naught to five. And why? Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs, the common infectious diseases of the eyes, the ears, the chest and the skin that, if they occur in the first five years of life, permanently damage those organs. They leave a lifelong remnant. That means that, by the age of five, you can't see as well for the rest of your life. You can't hear as well for the rest of your life. You can't breath as well. You've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five. And even skin infection, which we originally thought wasn't that big a problem, mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure, needing dialysis at age 40. This is a big deal, so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:35	<br><br>
	
Those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses we've looked at nationally around Australia, the same proportion. What you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not-so-famous houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people, 35 percent had a working shower. Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems, and 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet. These are by a simple, standard test: In the case of the shower, does it have hot and cold water, two taps that work, a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body, and a drain that takes the water away? Not well designed, not beautiful, not elegant -- just that they function. And the same test for the electrical system and the toilets. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
Housing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure. They're actually about improving houses. We start on day one of every project -- we've learned, we don't make promises, we don't do reports. We arrive in the morning with tools, tons of equipment, trades, and we train up a local team on the first day to start work. By the evening of the first day, a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning. That work continues for six to 12 months until all the houses are improved and we've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house. That's our average budget. At the end of six months to a year, we test every house again. It's very easy to spend money. It's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house, and for a whole house, the nine healthy living practices, we test, check and fix 250 items in every house. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:30	<br><br>
	
And these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars. We can get showers up to 86 percent working, we can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working, and we can get 90 percent of toilets working in those 7,500 houses. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:54	<br><br>
	
The teams do a great job, and that's their work. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
I think there's an obvious question that I hope you're thinking about. Why do we have to do this work? Why are the houses in such poor condition? Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance, the sort of things that happen in all our houses. Things wear out. Should have been done by state government or local government. Simply not done, the house doesn't work. Twenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction, literally things that are built upside down and back-to-front. They don't work. We have to fix them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:32	<br><br>
	
And if you've lived in Australia in the last 30 years, the final cause -- You will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses. It's one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence, which I've never seen evidence for, that's always ruled out as that's the problem with indigenous housing. Well, nine percent of what we spend is damage, misuse or abuse of any sort. We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem. And we'll go a lot further than that. The people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution. Seventy-five percent of our national team in Australia, over 75 at the minute, are actually local, indigenous people from the communities we work in. They do all aspects of the work. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:26	<br><br>
	
In 2010, for example, there were 831, all over Australia, and the Torres Strait Islands, all states, working to improve the houses where they and their families live, and that's an important thing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:40	<br><br>
	
Our work's always had a focus on health. That's the key. The developing world bug trachoma, it causes blindness. It's a developing world illness, and yet, the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:03	<br><br>
	
Okay, what do we do? Well, first thing we do, we get showers working. Why? Because that flushes the bug out. We put washing facilities in the school as well, so kids can wash their faces many times during the day. We wash the bug out. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
Second, the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick. So what do we do? We call up the doctor of dust, and there is such a person. He was loaned to us by a mining company. He controls dust on mining company sites, and he came out, and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust, so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids. So we used dirt to stop dust. We did it. He provided us dust monitors. We tested and we reduced the dust. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally. So how do we do that? Well, we call up the doctor of flies, and yes there is a doctor of flies. As our Aboriginal mate said, "You white fellows ought to get out more." (Laughter) And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug. He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide. They could trap the flies, send them to him in Perth. When the bug was in the gut, he'd send back by return post some dung beetles. The dung beetles ate the camel dung, the flies died through lack of food, and trachoma dropped. And over the year, trachoma dropped radically in this place, and stayed low. We changed the environment, not just treated the eyes. And finally, you get a good eye. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:49	<br><br>
	
All these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference. The New South Wales Department of Health, that radical organization, did an independent trial over three years to look at 10 years of the work we've been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales, and they found a 40-percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment. A 40-percent reduction. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia can be used in other places, I'm just going to go to one other place, and that's Nepal, and what a beautiful place to go. We were asked by a small village of 600 people to go in and make toilets where none existed. Health was poor. We went in with no grand plan, no grand promises of a great program, just the offer to build two toilets for two families. It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch, invited by the family into their main room of the house. It was choking with smoke. People were cooking on their only fuel source, green timber. The smoke coming off that timber is choking, and in an enclosed house, you simply can't breathe. Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:18	<br><br>
	
So all of a sudden we had two problems. We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground. That's fine. But all of a sudden now there was a second problem. How do we actually get the smoke down? So two problems, and design should be about more than one thing. Solution: Take human waste, take animal waste, put it into a chamber, out of that extract biogas, methane gas. The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean, smokeless and free for the family. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:49	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
I put it to you, is this eliminating poverty? And the answer from the Nepali team who is working at the minute would say, don't be ridiculous, we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim. And I don't pretend anything else. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:11	<br><br>
	
But as we all sit here today, there are now over 100 toilets built in this village and a couple nearby. Well over 1,000 people use those toilets. Yami Lama, he's a young boy. He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets, and there isn't human waste on the ground. Kanji Maya, she's a mother and a proud one. She's probably right now cooking lunch for her family on biogas, smokeless fuel. Her lungs have got better, and they'll get better as time increases, because she's not cooking in the same smoke. Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it's shed the gas, he puts it on his crops. He's trebled his crop income, more food for the family and more money for the family. And finally Bishnu, the leader of the team, has now understood that not only have we built toilets, we've also built a team, and that team is now working in two villages where they're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding. And that, to me, is the key. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:18	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:23	<br><br>
	
People are not the problem. We've never found that. The problem: poor living environment, poor housing, and the bugs that do people harm. None of those are limited by geography, by skin color or by religion. None of them. The common link between all the work we've had to do is one thing, and that's poverty. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:50	<br><br>
	
Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s, not too far from here, he said that like slavery and Apartheid, "Poverty is not natural. It's man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings." I want to end by saying it's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing, I think, extraordinary work, that have actually improved health, and, maybe only in a small way, reduced poverty. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much for your time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:26	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
“消除贫困”是一个伟大的目标。 我想在座各位都会赞同这点。 令我担心的是，当有钱的政客 和耀眼的摇滚明星们 使用这样的词语时， 这个目标听上去太过于轻松容易了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:37	<br><br>
	
我今天来一没带一大笔钱， 二也没什么政策可以发布， 很明显我也没拎把吉他上来。 我把这些东西留给别人去用吧。 不过，我倒是带了一个想法， 一个叫做“健康住所”的想法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
“健康住所”与穷人一起工作。 在他们住的地方开展工作， 目的是改善他们的卫生健康。 过去的28年里， 全澳大利亚，还有最近在海外地区， 有实实在在成千上万的人 干完了这项又脏、又苦、又累的工作， 并且他们的工作证明了，有针对性的方案 可以改善哪怕是最恶劣的生活环境。 这项工作可以改善卫生健康，就算是不能消除贫困， 也可以起到减轻贫困的作用。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:32	<br><br>
	
我来把这个故事从头讲起，1985年， 在澳大利亚中部。 有一位名叫亚米・莱斯特的土著男子， 当年正在提供医疗卫生服务。 他看过的百分之八十的病例， 都是传染性疾病―― 第三世界，或是发展中国家典型的、 因恶劣生活环境而引起的传染性疾病。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:57	<br><br>
	
亚米在艾丽斯斯普林斯（澳大利亚中部城市）组建了一支团队。 其中有一名医生， 还有一名环境卫生人员。 他亲自挑选了一支由当地土著人组成的医疗团队 来开展这个项目。 亚米在起初的那次会议上告诉我们，他们没有资金。 真是光脚的不怕穿鞋的，有前途！ 你有6个月的时间， 我让你去启动一个用他的土著语称为 “uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku”的项目， 翻译过来就是“不再有人生病计划”， 多么简练而深奥啊！ 那就我们的任务。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:41	<br><br>
	
第一步，那名医生走了 大概有半年时间， 他去进行研究调查，并得出 我们要认准的这九项卫生健康目标。 进行六个月的工作后，他来到我的办公室 递给我一张纸，上面写着这九个词。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:00	<br><br>
	
［九项健康居住做法：清洗、衣服、废水、营养、拥挤状况、动物+、灰尘、温度、损害］ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
我当时真的是无语了。 拜托！ 表达伟大的想法要用些高阶词汇 并且要多多益善才对吧。 这玩意儿也太差劲了吧。 但是你我没看出来的是， 他搜集整理了数千页的 当地、国家和全球健康研究报告， 并从这些报告中提炼出来 可以解释这些卫生健康目标的图片。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:31	<br><br>
	
我们很快拿到了这些图片， 使用图片的原因很简单。 我们的“老板们”（对“服务对象”打趣的说法）都是土著人 而且那些年长者大多都不识字， 所以我们必须用图片来传达信息 告诉他们这些目标。 我们要为这个社区服务， 就不可能用他们不懂的语言 去告诉他们将要发生的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:52	<br><br>
	
好吧，我们有了这些目标― 我就不一一列举了―― 每个目标都是以“人”和他们的健康问题为中心的， 然后将这些目标 和为保持他们良好健康而切实需要的 那些物理环境因素相联系。 其中最重要的一点，请看大屏幕， 就是人人每天清洗一次，尤其是给儿童。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:17	<br><br>
	
你们可能会想， “啥？就这么简单？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
好吧，我问诸位一个非常私人的问题。 今天早上出门前， 有谁可以冲澡？ 其实我问的很委婉， 我没直接问你们有没有洗澡。（笑声） 好吧，好吧。 我觉得可以不含糊地说，在座大部分人 今天早上都有冲澡的条件。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:41	<br><br>
	
现在我想请各位做件事 请各位在屏幕上的25所房子中， 选择一所。 请选好并留意 那所房子的位置 而且要记住它的位置。 选好了么？一定要选对哟， 因为我要让你在那儿住几个月。 这些房子位于西澳大利亚州的西北部，很不错的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
好了。我们来看看你房子里的淋浴器好不好使。 我听到一些“哦～～～”还有一些“啊～～～” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:09	<br><br>
	
恭喜打绿钩的朋友们，你们的淋浴器可以正常使用。 你们和你们孩子会没事儿的。 不过打了红叉的朋友们么， 我得仔细检查检查那间浴室 这对在座各位其实不会有什么影响。 为什么呢？因为各位的年龄都太大了。 我知道有人可能会觉得诧异， 但各位的年龄的确太大。 各位准备愤然离席之前， 我得解释一下，我说的“年龄太大” 意思是，基本上在座的每一位， 都超过5岁了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:38	<br><br>
	
而我们真正担心的是那些零到五岁的孩子。 为什么呢？因为清洗能够消灭那些 感染眼睛、耳朵、胸部和皮肤等 常见传染性疾病， 如果孩子在5岁之前染上这些疾病， 那些器官就会终身受损。 会贻害他们的终身。 也就是说，到五岁的时候， 你会失明，而且是终身失明。 你会失聪，而且是终身失聪。 你会呼吸困难。因为到5岁的时候， 你已经损失了三分之一的肺功能。 就连我们平时不在乎的肌肤感染 也会变成大问题， 五岁以前轻微的肌肤感染 将大大增加肾衰竭的几率， 你可能到40岁时就需要做透析了。 这可不是闹着玩儿的！所以屏幕上的这些钩钩叉叉 其实对小儿来说是至关重要的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:35	<br><br>
	
屏幕上这些钩钩和叉叉的比例， 和我们在澳大利亚全境调查过的7800所房子的比例， 相一致。 正如屏幕上所显示的 ― 有50000土著人民 住在其中35％的不起眼的房子里， 35％的房子配有能用的淋浴器。 那7800所相同房子中， 10%配有安全供电系统， 58％的房子 有可用的厕所。 检测标准很简单： 就淋浴而言，有没有冷热水， 两个龙头是否正常工作， 淋浴喷头能否出水， 地漏能否正常排水？ 无需考虑设计是否美观大方， 只要工作正常就行。 检测电力系统和厕所的标准也是这样的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
“健康住所”的项目不是为考量故障。 这些项目其实是为改善住房条件。 我们在每个项目确定的头一天就开工――经验告诉我们， 光说不练假把式，用不着承诺，也用不着打报告。 我们一早带来各种工具和很多设备， 同时，我们在开工第一天训练一支当地团队 来开展工作。 到第一天夜幕降临的时候， 那个社区中的一些房子 相比我们早上开工的时候，已经有所改善。 那项工作持续了半年到一年时间， 直到所有的房子都得以修善 每所房子总共花掉我们 7500美元的预算。 那是我们的平均预算。 在每个项目的最后，我们都会逐一复查每所房子。 想花钱很容易。 难的是改善一所房子里 所有那些部分的功能， 就一所房子而言，是指那九项健康居住做法， 我们测试、检查和维修每所房子的250项细节。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:30	<br><br>
	
这些是我们花费7500美元 所能实现的结果。 在那7500所房子中， 我们能让其中86%的淋浴器正常使用， 我们能让其中77％的电力系统正常运转， 我们能让其中90％的厕所正常使用。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:54	<br><br>
	
那就是我们团队的工作，他们真的很棒。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:59	<br><br>
	
你们可能在想一个问题 一个很明显的问题。 我们干嘛非要做这项工作？ 这些房子的条件为啥如此糟糕？ 我们工作的70％ 是修复因缺少常规维修而造成的故障， 那种在我们所有人家中都会发生的事儿。 什么东西坏了，不能用了，之类的。 州政府或当地政府本应做好这些事儿。 可惜他们没做，结果那些房子就出了问题。 我们工作的21％ 是修复因施工问题造成的故障， 什么东西装反了，装倒了之类的。 这些东西出了问题，我们就得去修。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:32	<br><br>
	
如果你在过去的30年里住在澳大利亚， 这最后一个原因――你一定早已耳闻 “土著人的垃圾住房”。 这似乎成为了铁一般的佐证， 虽然我从没亲眼见过， 这一伪证一直被认为是土著人住房问题的主要根源。 好吧，我们只有9％的工作是修复那些损坏、 误用、或滥用之类原因而造成的故障。 我们可以很明确说，住在房子的人 根本就不是问题所在。 不仅如此，我们更要说 住在房子里的人其实是 解决问题的主要力量。 我们在澳大利亚70％的团队成员 刚才这一百分比已经超过75％， 其实是当地的土著人民， 他们来自我们项目帮助过的社区。 所有方面的工作都是他们在干。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:21	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:26	<br><br>
	
比如，2010年， 在澳大利亚各州和托雷斯海峡诸岛， 我们有831人致力于改善 他们和他们家人所居住的房子， 这非常重要。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:40	<br><br>
	
我们的工作关注健康。这是关键。 发展中国家的沙眼病能够致盲。 这是一种发展中国家常见的疾病， 然而，这张图所显示的是 在上世纪90年代末的一个土著社区 其中，95％的学龄儿童患有活动性沙眼 损伤着他们的眼睛。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:03	<br><br>
	
好吧，怎么办？ 我们要做的第一件事，是让淋浴器工作正常。 为什么？因为淋浴可以洗掉眼睛里的病菌。 我们也在学校里安装了盥洗设施， 以保证孩子们可以每天洗上几次脸。 把病菌洗掉。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:17	<br><br>
	
接着，眼科医生告诉我们灰尘会摩擦眼睛， 使得病菌很快地侵入眼内。怎么办？ 我们找来一位灰尘医生，别不信，真有这样的医生。 一个采矿公司把他借调给我们。 他在那家公司的矿区中专职控制灰尘， 然后他来帮忙，花了不到一天的时间 发现这个社区里的大多数灰尘 集中漂浮在距离地面一米的范围内，属于风动灰尘， 于是他建议用造土堆的方法 来阻挡灰尘飘进居住区域 去影响孩子们的眼睛。 所以我们用土阻挡了粉尘。 我们做到了。他给了我们几个灰尘检测器。 我们检测后发现灰尘的确减少了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:54	<br><br>
	
然后我们要搞定那些病菌。 怎么办？ 我们找来了一位苍蝇医生， 没错儿，真有干这行的医生。 就像我们土著哥们儿说的那样， “你们这帮白人应该多出去走走，长长见识。” （笑声） 然后这位苍蝇医生很快就找出了 携带那种病菌的苍蝇。 他给这个社区的学生们发放了 幻灯上显示的这种别致的捕蝇器。 学生们抓到苍蝇以后，将它们送回苍蝇医生在珀斯的研究室。 因为这些病菌生活在苍蝇的内脏中，于是苍蝇医生从珀斯 寄回来了一些屎壳郎虫。 这些屎壳郎给力地抢食苍蝇们的骆驼粪， 导致苍蝇们因为食物短缺而死亡， 沙眼病菌的也就减少了。 一年之后，当地的沙眼病菌 大幅减少，而且一直很少。 我们不仅仅治了眼病，还改变了环境。 最终，还你一双明亮的眼睛。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:49	<br><br>
	
这些小小的健康成果 和健康难题中的那些小问题，产生了巨大的不同。 新南威尔士卫生部， 那个激进的组织， 用三年多时间做了一个独立的追踪调查 调查我们10年来 在新南威尔士地区所做的这类项目， 结果他们发现， 因恶劣环境而致病的入院人数 减少了40％。 40％啊朋友们！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
我还想展示一下，我们把在澳大利亚的工作原理 应用到世界上其他地方， 我只展示其中的一个地方，就是尼泊尔， 多么美丽的地方！ 那儿有一个600人的小村子， 请我们去解决当地没有厕所的问题。 那儿卫生条件很差。 我们去的时候，没有宏伟的计划，也没有对伟大方案 的庄严承诺，我们就是去 给两户人家修建两个厕所。 在我们设计第一个厕所的时候 我被请去那户人家吃午饭。 当我走到他们客厅的时候， 屋里浓烟滚滚。 人们正用他们的唯一燃料 ― 生木材烧饭。 那股烟真是太呛了， 要是在一个密闭房间里，会熏死人的。 之后，我们发现当地居民最大的病因和死因 就是呼吸系统衰竭。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:18	<br><br>
	
于是一下子我们又多出了一个新问题。 我们本来是去察看厕所情况 解决随地大小便问题。这不难办。 但是一下子我们有了第二个问题。 我们怎样才能搞定这股浓烟？总共俩问题， 我们的设计方案就不能孤注一掷。 解决办法：把人畜粪便， 堆进一个小房间内，从而提取沼气， 就是甲烷气体。 这家人每天可以用这种洁净、无烟而且免费的气体， 烧3到4小时的饭。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:49	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:54	<br><br>
	
我要问一个诸位：“这算不算消除贫困？” 正在工作的尼泊尔团队 估计会说：别逗了， 先把剩下的300万个厕所建好 再讨论这个问题吧。 我没有吹嘘。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:11	<br><br>
	
就在我们今天坐在这儿的时候， 这个村子和周边的二个村里 已经建好了100多个厕所。 有1000多人使用这些厕所。 有一位少年名叫雅美・喇嘛， 曾患有脏器感染。因为现在用上了厕所， 他的病症明显减轻了， 而且再也没人随地大小便了。 有位自豪的母亲名叫康吉玛雅。 她现在可能正在用无烟燃料― 沼气 为她的家人做饭。 她的肺现在好多了，而且今后会越来越好 因为她已经彻底告别浓烟。 苏尔亚将正在制造沼气的粪肥 施在他的庄稼上。 他的庄稼现在带给他原来三倍的收入， 带给一家人更多的粮食和更多的金钱。 还有比什努， 当地团队的带头人，现在明白了 我们不仅修建了厕所， 同时我们也培养了一支团队， 这支团队现在正在两个村子里干活 同时他们也在训练下两个村里的村民 不断扩展这项工作。 我觉得这才是关键。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:18	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:23	<br><br>
	
“人”不是问题所在。 我们向来都是这么认为的。 真正的问题出在：恶劣的居住环境， 糟糕的住房条件，还有各种损害人体健康的病原体。 所有这些问题都不受地域、 肤色或宗教信仰的限制。 串联着我们所有工作的是 两个字：贫穷。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:50	<br><br>
	
纳尔逊・曼德拉在二十一世纪一十年代中叶， 那个并不遥远的过去，他曾说过， 就像奴隶制和种族隔离一样，“贫困现象不是自然的， 它是人为的，人类可以通过采取各种行动 来战胜和根除贫困现象。“ 最后，我想说的是 正是通过成千上万普通人的行动 和他们杰出的工作， 健康水平才真正得以提高， 而且，通过一点一滴的努力，减轻了贫困。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
感谢各位到场！ 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Imagine a European democracy without borders</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Greece has been the poster child for European economic crisis, but former Prime Minister George Papandreou wonders if it's just a preview of what's to come. “Our democracies," he says, "are trapped by systems that are too big to fail, or more accurately, too big to control” ― while "politicians like me have lost the trust of their peoples." How to solve it? Have citizens re-engage more directly in a new democratic bargain. 	<br><br>

This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given. I will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy. And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions. But I will in the end urge you to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:49	<br><br>
	
Failure of leadership. What is the failure of leadership today? And why is our democracy not working? Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process. So let me, from my personal experiences, give you an insight, so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:21	<br><br>
	
Let's start from the beginning. Let's start from democracy. Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks, it was a revelation, a discovery, that we had the potential, together, to be masters of our own fate, to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine, and then to design a better life. And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom, because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact, whether they be despots or dogmas, could be the protagonists. Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants or of high priests, their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:22	<br><br>
	
Well, I first began to understand this when I was 14 years old. I used to, to try to avoid homework, sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly. You see, then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country, and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where, maybe, the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:55	<br><br>
	
I used to join him in many of the campaigns, and you can see me here next to him. I'm the younger one there, to the side. You may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:07	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:09	<br><br>
	
So in 1967, elections were coming, things were going well in the campaign, the house was electric. We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:23	<br><br>
	
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house. Soldiers storm the door. They find me up on the top terrace. A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun, puts it to my head, and says, "Tell me where your father is or I will kill you." My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself, and was summarily taken to prison. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:51	<br><br>
	
Well, we survived, but democracy did not. Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:01	<br><br>
	
Now, today, our democracies are again facing a moment of truth. Let me tell you a story. Sunday evening, Brussels, April 2010. I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union. I had just been elected prime minister, but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not 6 percent, as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government, but actually 15.6 percent. But the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that Greece was facing, and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually, to tackle these problems, whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance, or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system, politics and media captured by special interests. But despite our electoral mandate, the markets mistrusted us. Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing, and we were facing possible default. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
So I went to Brussels on a mission to make the case for a united European response, one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms. But time we didn't get. Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels. Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high, progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2, a prime minister shouts out, "We have to finish in 10 minutes." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:50	<br><br>
	
I said, "Why? These are important decisions. Let's deliberate a little bit longer." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
Another prime minister comes in and says, "No, we have to have an agreement now, because in 10 minutes, the markets are opening up in Japan, and there will be havoc in the global economy." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes. This time it was not the military, but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads. What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life, painful to me, painful to my countrymen, imposing cuts, austerity, often on those not to blame for the crisis. With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:45	<br><br>
	
Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis, and some people blame me for pulling the trigger. But I think today that most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone, vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system, vulnerabilities of our democracies. Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail, or, more accurately, too big to control. Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws, evade taxes, evade environmental or labor standards. Our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth, lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster, have constrained our democracies, and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential, in finding solutions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:53	<br><br>
	
Greece, you see, was only a preview of what is in store for us all. I, overly optimistically, had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe, for the world, to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions. Instead, I had a very humbling experience. In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions, I realized that not one, not one of us, had ever dealt with a similar crisis. But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance. We were led by our fears. And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity. Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies, investing in it to find more creative solutions, we reverted to political posturing. And then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis, and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective European failure, and of course that was Greece. Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks, they are the problem. Punish them! Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:26	<br><br>
	
But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece. This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems, whether it's climate change, whether it's migration, whether it's the financial system. That is, abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential, falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas, taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens. And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens, of our peoples, even more in the democratic process. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:08	<br><br>
	
It's no wonder that many political leaders, and I don't exclude myself, have lost the trust of our people. When riot police have to protect parliaments, a scene which is increasingly common around the world, then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies. That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package. My European counterparts, some of them, at least, said, "You can't do this. There will be havoc in the markets again." I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets, we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:54	<br><br>
	
Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect. We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe, but we remain challenged. If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential, well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece, and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. So far, we've thrown economics at the problem, actually mostly austerity, and certainly we could have designed alternatives, a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs, or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures, these would have been much more viable alternatives. Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:45	<br><br>
	
So let's try something else. Let's see how we can bring people back to the process. Let's throw democracy at the problem. Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings, believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments. In people we trust. Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities for public affairs. Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day. Science, theater, research, philosophy, games of the mind and the body, they were daily exercises. Actually they were an education for participation, for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:33	<br><br>
	
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots. You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens, that term originated there. "Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself. A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded, someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs. And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings, both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation. You see, markets and politics then were one, unified, accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people. They serve the demos, democracy. Above government, above markets was the direct rule of the people. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:23	<br><br>
	
Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions. So our politicians are limited to local politics, while our citizens, even though they see a great potential, are prey to forces beyond their control. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:43	<br><br>
	
So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora? How do we democratize globalization? And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G20. I'm talking about, how do we secure the space, the demos, the platform of values, so that we can tap into all of your potential? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:04	<br><br>
	
Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in. Europe, despite its recent failures, is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment. So let's see if it can't be an experiment in global democracy, a new kind of democracy. Let's see if we can't design a European agora, not simply for products and services, but for our citizens, where they can work together, deliberate, learn from each other, exchange between art and cultures, where they can come up with creative solutions. Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president, or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues, a European-wide referendum where our citizens, as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties. And here's an idea: Why not have the first truly European citizens by giving our immigrants, not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship, but a European citizenship? And make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe. Where our common identity is democracy, where our education is through participation, and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia. Europe of and by the people, a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:54	<br><br>
	
Now, some might accuse me of being naive, putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people. Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist. Believe me, I have been, I am, part of today's political system, and I know things must change. We must revive politics as the power to imagine, reimagine, and redesign for a better world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:28	<br><br>
	
But I also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today. The revival of democratic politics will come from you, and I mean all of you. Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas, whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally, where everybody lives, everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality, everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy, dogma rather than critical thinking, technocracy rather than democracy, everyone who stands up to the unchecked power, whether it's authoritarian leaders, plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens, or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:17	<br><br>
	
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots. Let's not be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:25	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:37	<br><br>
	
Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets, and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me, as a citizen, is terrifying. Help us understand how you felt after the decision. It was not a good decision, clearly, but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister, but as George? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:00	<br><br>
	
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted, and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all, hurt the younger generation, and not only, many of them are demonstrating outside, but I think this is one of our problems. When we face these crises, we have kept the potential, the huge potential of our society out of this process, and we are closing in on ourselves in politics, and I think we need to change that, to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology, the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions which are much better, but we have to be open. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:52	<br><br>
	
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. It's rather the other way -- more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the European construction. How do you reconcile that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:10	<br><br>
	
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders, go beyond our conflicts and work together. And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game, we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together, while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:38	<br><br>
	
Now, more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels. It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe, that is, really making Europe a project of the people. So that, I think, would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:55	<br><br>
	
BG: George, thank you for coming to TED. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:57	<br><br>
	
GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause) 	<br><br>

今天(的演讲)将不像我过去做的 的任何一个演讲 今天我想给你们讲的是 国际政治中失效的领导能力 和我们正走向国际化的经济 我不带给你们一些看似美好的现成解决方案 但最终我要敦促你们 反思并勇于承担风险,参与到 在我看来是全球范围的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:42	<br><br>
	
民主变革中来 （让我们来谈一下）失效的领导力 在当今社会，什么是失效的领导力？ 究竟为什么我们的民主政策不管用？ 我认为失效的领导力指的是 我们没有把你们（公众）带入民主全球化的进程中 好吧，让我从我个人的经历来 讲一下我的想法，借此你可以退一步 去理解为什么应对 当今社会的挑战是如此困难 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
为什么政治正走向死胡同 让我们从头来讲吧 让我们从民主开始讲吧 嗯，如果你回到古希腊 它代表一种启示，一项发现 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:32	<br><br>
	
民主表明我们有潜力能够一起努力 成为我们命运的主人 能够检验、学习、想象 然后一起设计一个更美好的生活 民主既是一个政治上的创新 同时也保护我们的自由生活 （因为民主）我们能够从恐惧中解放出来 这样我们的内心坚定 无论面临着专制主义或是教条主义的时候 （我们）都是自己的主人 民主曾是一个政治创新，让我们得以 限制强权，无论它是来自恶势力 或是大祭司 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
这些人的天性就是最大化他们的强权和财富 嗯，我最早意识到这一点 是在我14岁的时候 我为了逃避做作业 遛到客厅去听我父母 和他们的朋友激烈辩论 你知道，希腊过去是 在极强大的极权统治之下的 这种极权扼制了国家（的发展） 我父亲当时在领导一个大有希望的（政治）运动 来重新设想希腊，来设想 一个由自由主宰的，而且一个 由人民、公民来统治的国家 我过去曾参与许多我父亲的竞选活动 你可以（从照片上看到）我站在他旁边 我是他左边的那个少年 你可能认不出我来了，因为 我过去的发型与现在略有不同 （观众笑声） 在1967年竞选时 竞选活动非常顺利 众议院是一片热闹的景象 我们真的感觉到了 这将使希腊迈出一大步 然而一个晚上，一辆军用卡车开到我家 士兵涌进门 他们在露台发现我 一个警官手提机枪走上前 顶着我的脑袋，说 “告诉我你爸在哪里，不然我杀了你” 我藏在一旁的父亲走了出来 即刻被他们押到了监狱 我们活了下来，可惜民主没有 残暴的独裁统治的7年里 我们在流亡中度过 今天，我们的民主政治再次到了 面临真理的时刻 让我来给你们讲述一个故事 一个星期日的晚上， 布鲁塞尔，2010年4月 我和一些欧盟同行坐在一起 我刚刚被选为总理 身为总理我不幸地公布这样一个事实 我们的财务亏损并不是6% 那个几天前 在竞选以前，由前任政府所公布的数据 事实上，我们的财务亏损是15.6% 但财务亏损仅是 希腊面临的更深层问题的一个体现 我当选之际，承担的一个使命就是 解决这些深层问题 不论是政府行政缺乏透明度 和责任感 还是一个地方保护主义的州政府 让利给强权势力－给他们免税 被全球逃税体系和 特殊利益集团控制下的政界、媒体所怂恿教唆 尽管我们由选举授权 市场仍旧无法信任我们 我们的借贷利率仍旧疯涨 我们那时正面临负债的可能 于是我带着一个使命来到布鲁塞尔 向欧盟叙述现状，以期得到回应 从而稳定市场，并给我们时间 来进行必要的改革 但我们未得到（足够的）时间 想象一下你坐在布鲁赛尔的谈判桌上 谈判很艰难，局势很紧张 整个过程进行得十分缓慢，1点50分的时候 某国一总理喊起来 “我们必须10分钟内结束会议。” 我问，“为什么？这些是重要的决定。 我们再花点时间商议一下。“ 另一国总理插话说， ”不行，我们不得不达成一致， 因为10分钟以后， 日本市场将开盘， 全球经济将一片浩劫。” 我们迅速在10分钟内达成协议 这一次，不是军队 而是市场，用机枪顶住了我们所有人的脑袋 接下来我做了一生最困难的决定 这不仅令我痛苦，也令我的国民痛苦 强行削减政策，财政紧缩 受重挫的往往是那些无辜的人们 由于这样的牺牲，希腊确实没有破产 欧元体系也没有崩溃 希腊，是的，引起了欧元危机 而且有些人埋怨是我扣动了扳机 但我认为今天大多数人都同意 希腊(的问题）仅是一个表象 是一些在欧元区更深层、更本质问题的一个表象 是更大范围的全球经济系统漏洞的一个表象 我们民主政治漏洞的一个表象。 我们的民主政治深陷于“强大得永不坍塌”的系统 或者，更准确地说，“强大得无法驾驭”的系统 我们的民主政治在全球经济环境中被削弱 （民主）被那些逃避法律、逃避税收的人（所削弱） （民主）被那些破坏环境和劳动力标准的人（所削弱） 我们的民主政治 被日益加剧的不平等和 权富集中所削弱 政治游说、贪污腐败、市场化的进程 或仅仅是我们面临灾难的那种恐惧 制约了我们的民主 制约了我们 设想和发挥潜能的能力 你们的潜能 寻求解决方案的潜能 你所看到的希腊只是一场预演 这是我们所有人都将面临的景象 我曾天真地希望 这个危机提供了一个机会，让希腊，让欧洲 进行全世界范围内大幅度的民主改革 改革我们的组织机构 可是正相反，我却有了一次非常屈辱的经历 在布鲁塞尔，当我们一次又一次绝望地努力着 去寻求共同的解决方案（的时候） 我认识到，我们中没有一个人 曾处理过类似的危机 更糟糕的是，我们陷入共同的无知中 被恐惧牵着鼻子走 恐惧带着我们走向盲目的信念 对紧缩政策的信奉 没有向大众 抑或是社会集体智慧（求助） （没有）花时间寻找有创见性的解决方案 我们再次摆出了政治姿态 接着我们惊讶地发现 临时推出的方案未能结束危机 当然了，这很容易（让我们）想找到 寻找一个替罪羊 来为整个欧洲的失败买单 毫无疑问，这替罪羊就是希腊 那些挥霍无度的、闲散的、一边畅饮茴香酒，一边狂跳左巴舞的希腊人 他们就是问题所在。惩罚他们！ 这随便的毫无依据的陈旧思维 往往比财政紧缩带来的危害更大 我要提醒你，这不仅是希腊的问题 这可能是一个思维模式的问题 使领导者们一次又一次遵循 处理复杂跨国问题固有的思维模式的问题 不论是气候问题，是移民问题 还是金融调解问题 我们抛弃集体力量 不充分发挥我们的潜力 而选择成为恐惧，机械，教条的牺牲品 把公民排除在决策层之外 而不是以公民意见为核心来决策 这样做的结果是 考验了我们的公民、人民，甚至 （考验了）整个民主进程的信念 难怪很多政治领导 包括我自己 失去了人民的信任 警察需要从骚乱中保护国会 这一场面在世界各地越来越常见 （那是因为）我们的民主政治出现了深层的问题 这就是为什么我主张公投，借此让希腊人民自己 决定援救计划的各个条款 我的欧洲同行们，至少其中一部分说， “你不能这么做。 这样又会导致一场市场浩劫。” 我回答说，“我们需要这么做，在恢复对市场的信心以前， 我们需要恢复人民的信心与信任。” 离政以后，我有时间来进行反思 我们经受了在希腊和欧洲的风暴 但我们仍面临挑战 如果政治决策层拥有设想和发挥潜力的能力 那么在希腊以及其他国家60%的青年失业率 证明了我们缺乏合理的设想 缺乏应有的同情心 到现在为止，我们将这个问题归因于经济状况 事实上绝大部分是由于财政紧缩 当然我们本可以想其他的办法 不同的策略，（比如）鼓励绿色产业刺激就业 或互惠借贷，用欧元债券 帮助那些困于市场压力的国家 这些应该是更可行的办法 但我相信问题的根本不仅仅 是一个经济问题，而是一个民主问题 让我们试试其他的办法 让我们把人民带入这个过程中来 让我们用民主来解决问题 古希腊，即便有种种不足 最辉煌的时期，他们相信群众的智慧 相信值得信赖的人民 民主需要人民通过 商议、辩论、承担公共事务中的责任 对公共事务进行决策。 大多数公民常被选为公民陪审团 来裁决当日重要案件 科技，戏剧，研究，哲学 是心灵与身体的游戏 是一种日常演习 事实上通过参与，公民得以进行自我教育 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:30	<br><br>
	
因此提高我们公民的潜能 那些避开政治的人是蠢货 蠢货一词源于古希腊和雅典 来自词根“idio"，意思是”自己“ 一个自我为中心的、与世隔离，被排斥了的人 一个不参与或不思考公共事务的人 应该参与在集市中来。集市有两个意思 既指市场， 又指政治商酌的地方 你看，市场和政治是实际上是统一的 是可接近的，透明的，因为他们同样给人民以力量 让他们为民主服务 （让民主）高于政府，高于市场 由人民直接统治 今天我们已经有了全球化市场 但是我们还没有全球化的民主组织 所以我们的政治家仍旧局限于本地政治 即便人民可以看到更美好的希望 仍旧被强权所吞噬 那么我们怎样重新整合市场经济和政治体系呢？ 我们怎样将全球化民主化呢？ 我不是在讨论如何 对联合国或G20进行必要的改革 我是在说，我们怎样保留 民主和价值体系的平台 在此之基础上我们可以挖掘全部的潜能 这恰恰是欧洲的情况 欧洲，尽管近来失利， 仍旧是世界最成功的跨国和平共处的实验平台 所以让我们来看一看它是否也可以成为 全球民主的实验地，一种新的民主 让我们看看是否我们可以设计一个欧洲集市 不仅是提供产品和服务的集市 也是人民进行交流的集市 互相讨论，相互学习 进行艺术与文化的交流 在这里他们可以提出有创意的解决方案 让我们想象一下”欧洲公民“ 可以投票 直选出一个”欧洲主席“ 或者抽签选出陪审团 商酌重要的有争议的问题 在欧洲范围内公投，我们的公民 作为法律的制定者，为未来的法律条约投票 我有个想法 能不能有第一批真正的“欧洲公民” 给各地移民一个“欧洲公民”的身份 不是希腊公民、德国公民、瑞典公民， 而是”欧洲公民“？ 保证他们的权利 让失业人士拥有”奖学金券“ 让他们随意选择在欧洲的任何地方进行深造 这样我们共同的身份是民主 这样我们的教育是通过参与 这种参与能够建立信任、团结 而不是排斥与仇外 欧洲属于人民，由人民统治 在欧洲，推行更深更广的 跨国界的民主政治实验 或许有人认为我天真地 过度信赖于人民的力量与智慧 有了几十年参政经验的我，也已经变成了一个实用主义者 相信我，我曾经是 现在仍是当今政治体系中一部分 我知道这一切必须改变 我们必须将政治的复兴作为一种力量来设想 来重新设想、设计出一个更美好的世界 但我也知道这种改变的颠覆性力量 不是来自于目前的政治决策层 民主政治的复兴 将来自你们，我指你们所有人 全球每一个参与交流的人 不管是今天到场的人 还是场外的人 网络上的人，还是住在某地的人， 每个反对不公正不平等的人 每个反对 那些宣扬种族歧视、无同情心的人 那些教条主义、无辩证思考的人 那些官僚的、无民主思想的人 每一个反对不受制约的强权的人 不论是专制的领导人 还是逃税来隐藏资产的财阀 还是保护一小撮强权者的政治说客 这些人希望我们所有人都是蠢货 我们偏不！ 谢谢 （观众掌声） （主持人）你似乎描述了一个政治家 有点措手不及地 深陷于金融市场风暴的囹圄中 你描述的布鲁塞尔的场面对于我来说 一个普通公民来说确实够可怕的 请描述一下您做出决定以后的心情 显然那不是好决定 但你心情是怎样的？不是作为总理 而是作为乔治（你自己）？ （乔治・帕潘德里欧）显然当时确实有这样的困难 令我以及其他人无法做出 我们想要做的决定 我当然希望我们有时间 通过改革来处理财务亏损 而不是试图消减财务亏损 那只是问题的表象 这么做是不利的。不利是因为，首先 对年轻一代不利 而且他们很多人在外示威 但我认为这是问题之一 当我们面临危机时，我们忽略了我们的潜力 忽略了此过程中来自社会的巨大潜力 我们封闭在政治之中 我认为我们就是需要改变这个，寻求 一种以新的方式来参与决策的能力 （这种能力）现在甚至存在于科技中，不仅是科技 也存在于我们的信念中。我认为我们可以找到 更好的解决方式，但是我们一定需要有开放的心态 （主持人）你似乎建议下一步 主要是欧洲开始施行（民主政治），这可不太容易做到 特别是现在的一些欧洲国家 它们正好相反，他们开始封闭国界 减少合作，甚至将退出 某些欧盟内的组织 您是怎样看待这个问题的呢？ (乔治・帕潘德里欧) 我认为在危机发生后的恶果之一 就是我们开始了相互责备 欧盟最基本的观念是 我们可以跨越国界合作 抛开分歧，共同努力 然而矛盾的是，因为我们开始了相互责备 我们失去了赢得人心的机会 现在正是我们需要 齐心协力的时刻 现在，欧洲不需要把 权利交给布鲁塞尔 而是要交给欧洲人民 让欧洲成为一个“人民工程” 所以我认为，可以通过这个来回应 一些社会上的恐慌 （主持人）感谢您光临Ted讲台 （乔治・帕潘德里欧）十分感谢。（主持人）谢谢。（观众掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Why Google Glass?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
It's not a demo, more of a philosophical argument: Why did Sergey Brin and his team at Google want to build an eye-mounted camera/computer, codenamed Glass? Onstage at TED2013, Brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers ― not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads-up. 	<br><br>

Okay, it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video? 	<br><br>

Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. He needs help getting 10 million dollars. I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass. Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information. Should it be by just walking around looking down? But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor. Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone, it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body? You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. You're just kind of moving around. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:57	<br><br>
	
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands? You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there. They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:11	<br><br>
	
And also you want something that frees your eyes. That's why we put the display up high, out of your line of sight, so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it. And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all. You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:11	<br><br>
	
This project has lasted now, been just over two years. We've learned an amazing amount. It's been really important to make it comfortable. So our first prototypes we built were huge. It was like cell phones strapped to your head. It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable. We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job, and then she almost ran away screaming. But we've come a long way. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:40	<br><br>
	
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera. Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all, but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family, my kids. I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device, that I also kind of have a nervous tic. The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that, but it's also kind of a nervous habit. Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead. I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler. You know, I'd be like -- But in this case, you know, I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to. But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away, be it email or social posts or whatnot, even though it wasn't really -- there's nothing really that important or that pressing. And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:52	<br><br>
	
Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more, doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:59	<br><br>
	
Thank you all very much. 	<br><br>

再次回到TED演讲感觉真不错。 让我播放一段视频作为开场吧! 	<br><br>

(视频)男：眼镜, 开始录像。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:26	<br><br>
	
女：一切就绪，2分钟后上场。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:30	<br><br>
	
男2：眼镜，叫'飞行俱乐部'一起来玩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:34	<br><br>
	
男3：眼镜，搜索老虎头的照片。唔！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:39	<br><br>
	
男4：准备好了吗？准备好了吗？(狗吠声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:41	<br><br>
	
女2：就这样！眼镜，照张相。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:47	<br><br>
	
(孩子的叫声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:57	<br><br>
	
男5：飞了! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:02	<br><br>
	
男6：天啊！[哔]！棒极了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
小孩：哇! 快看这条蛇! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
女3：眼镜，快录像！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
男7：过了这座桥后由第一个出口出去。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:44	<br><br>
	
男8：好的，A12,就在那！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
(掌声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
(孩子的歌声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:57	<br><br>
	
男9：眼镜，查查“美味的”用泰语怎么说。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
谷歌眼镜：  男9：嗯, 。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
女4：眼镜，查一下"水母"。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:08	<br><br>
	
(音乐声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:19	<br><br>
	
男10：太漂亮了！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:22	<br><br>
	
(掌声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:30	<br><br>
	
谢尔盖・布林：不好意思，我刚才在看尼日利亚王子发来的短信。 他要我帮忙筹一千万美元。 我很关注这样的事， 因为我们的公司就是这样(筹资)成立的， 而且我们经营的还不错。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:49	<br><br>
	
不过话说回来， 也许刚才大家也注意到了 我低头看手机的姿势， 这是谷歌眼镜计划开展的一个原因。 因为我们终究会产生疑问 未来人们会用怎样的方式取代手机 联系家人和朋友， 你又想怎样获取信息。 不能总是边走边低头看手机吧? 这是谷歌眼镜的理念的根源， 这也是我们将产品设计成眼镜形状的主要原因。 我就不详细介绍谷歌眼镜的功能了， 但我想多讲一点 关于开发谷歌眼镜背后的动机。 除了外出时边走边看手机 会潜移默化的将你隔绝在社会团体之外， 其实，你真的要这样对待你的身体吗？ 你站在那 触碰着 平淡无奇的手机屏幕， 机械的移来移去。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:57	<br><br>
	
在开发谷歌眼镜时，我们真的在想， 我们是否可以设计出一种设备来解放我们的双手呢？ 刚刚你们看到了视频中的人 做的一些事情。 他们都戴上了谷歌眼镜， 所以才能拍摄到这种视频。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:11	<br><br>
	
同时你也想解放你的眼睛。 所以，我们将显示器放在稍高的位置， 它比你的视线稍高一点。 这样它就不会挡住你的视野、 不会妨碍你与人们的 眼神交流。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
同时，我们还想解放人们的双耳， 所以声音会由这传过来， 直接传至头骨， 最初你可能会感觉有点怪，但慢慢就会习惯的。 有点讽刺意味的是，如果你想听得更清楚， 你盖住耳朵就行， 这听起来很令人吃惊，但事实就是这样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
15年前在谷歌成立之初，我的初衷是： 最终人们不再 需要任何搜索引擎。 你可以随心所欲地想要什么信息就有什么信息。 而现在，15个年头过去了， 我想，我们最初的构想， 现在可以由谷歌眼镜来实现了， 它可以解决当你外出、在街上逛荡时、 轻松地、不需要低头看手机地与人交谈等等。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:11	<br><br>
	
到目前为止,这项计划已经开展了两年多。 我们得到一些不错的数据。 让使用者感到舒适真的很重要 我们制造的的第一批样品型号巨大。 就像把手机绑在了头上。 很重，令人感到非常不舒服。 我们不能让我们的工业设计师知道这事 直到她最终接受这份工作， 后来,她差不多是尖叫着跑掉了。 但是我们已经取得了很大的进步。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:40	<br><br>
	
另一个意想不到的惊喜就是摄像功能。 我们最初的原型机是完全没有摄像功能的， 但如果能捕获与家人和孩子相处的瞬间 那会是一件多么神奇的事啊。 我从未想到过会找到这样一款相机、 电话或其他什么东西来记录这些时刻。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
后来,我意识到,在试用这款设备的过程中， 我似乎产生了某种神经性反应， 手机需要你低下头使用， 这也是一种神经性反映。 就像如果我过去吸烟,可能我现在还是要吸。 只要点支烟就好了，看起来会更酷。 你知道,就像这样-- 但在这种情况下,我拿出手机 坐在那看,就像在处理什么 重要的事情。 但实际上,我眼睁睁的看着自己花费大量的时光 却只是使自己远离人群， 做着发邮件、发微博这类事情， 即使这些事不是真的-- 不是真的那么重要和紧迫。 用谷歌眼镜,我知道我会获得这些消息 如果我真的需要的话， 但是我不必总是查看他们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:52	<br><br>
	
我很享受更多地去探索和了解这个世界 做更多正如你在视频中看到的疯狂的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:59	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Hack a banana, make a keyboard!</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Why can't two slices of pizza be used as a slide clicker? Why shouldn't you make music with ketchup? In this charming talk, inventor Jay Silver talks about the urge to play with the world around you. He shares some of his messiest inventions, and demos MaKey MaKey, a kit for hacking everyday objects. 	<br><br>

Hey guys. It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver, because that was, like, I loved it, and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden." And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter) And it worked really well there. And you know, it had a profound effect on me. It sounds silly, but I thought, okay, the way the world works can be changed, and it can be changed by me in these small ways. And my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this, well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
And so, about 20 years later, I didn't realize the full effect of this, but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there, and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them, and they could make beds out of trees, and they could -- I watched this woman for three days. I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart, these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads, like strings, and she would weave the strings together, and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days, the materiality of the way the world works, of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind, because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener, everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to, maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
And so I had to start studying, who is it that's making these decisions? Who's making these things? How did they make them? What stops us from making them? Because this is how reality is created. So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab, and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity. And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:10	<br><br>
	
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp, where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything. So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together, you know, make something, I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you. We won't bring anything with us. And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults and teens to do. Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream, and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together. A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass. The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it. And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:56	<br><br>
	
And the creator of this, he said, "This is fire. I call this fire." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
And someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
And he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
And I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing. He doesn't know, but he can show you." So his hands know and his intuition knows, but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be, especially when it comes to the human-made, human-built world. We think we already know how something works, so we can't imagine how it could work. We know how it's supposed to work, so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:30	<br><br>
	
So kids don't have as hard of a time with this, and I saw in my own son, I gave him this book. I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like, "Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon. I'm going to give you some building blocks and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks, so it's totally legit." But he doesn't really know what to do with these. I didn't show him. And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this." This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest. Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff. And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around, and he enlists us in helping him. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:11	<br><br>
	
And at this point, I'm starting to wonder, what kind of tools can we give people, especially adults, who know too much, so that they can see the world as malleable, so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives. Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works, pushing what matter can do, the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium, and any sufficiently complicated task, whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child -- anything that's complicated -- comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it, and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say, "Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this. I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing. I'm going to use them a different way." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:53	<br><br>
	
So let me show you a little demo. This is a little piano circuit right in here, and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with. (Beeping) And so, with some ketchup, ― (musical notes) ― and then I can kind of ― (musical notes) ― (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:22	<br><br>
	
And that's awesome, right? But this is not what's awesome. What's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people. A pencil is not just a pencil. Look what it has in the middle of it. That's a wire running down the middle, and not only is it a wire, if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil, and you can lay out wire on the page, too, and get electrical current to run through it. And so you can kind of hack a pencil, just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:56	<br><br>
	
And the electricity runs through your body too. And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil. You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. All you do is connect to the bristles, and the bristles are wet, so they conduct, and the person's body conducts, and leather is great to paint on, and then you can start hooking to everything, even the kitchen sink. The metal in the sink is conductive. Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
(Musical notes) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:27	<br><br>
	
And you can even hook to the trees. Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive, and you can use those together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:33	<br><br>
	
So ― (Laughter) ― I took this to those same teens, because those teens are really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try. I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to. And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper, and as the hula hoop traveled around her body, she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there. You can see her pointing to it in the picture. And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body, it would connect two little pieces of copper tape, and it would make a sound, and the next sound, and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:03	<br><br>
	
I ran these workshops everywhere. In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue. And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it. And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump, were inviting me to give workshops, just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together. And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics, but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:39	<br><br>
	
And so I just want to do a quick demo. So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit, and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB. And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one. And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. And now, if I touch this piece of pizza, the slides that I showed you before should go forward. And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up, now I have a left arrow and a right arrow, so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:23	<br><br>
	
And so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this." Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:31	<br><br>
	
So we made a video to prove that there's lots of stuff you can do. You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh and just Google for game controllers. Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special. And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises) And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target? Well, if you take those out, they hold water great, but you can totally cut your toes, so yeah, just be careful. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:02	<br><br>
	
You know the Happiness Project, where the experts are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is? Well, I think it's cool, but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works. We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:18	<br><br>
	
Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat. Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS. Hover the mouse over the "take a photo" button, and you've got a little cat photo booth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:27	<br><br>
	
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this. If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market. And so we put it up on Kickstarter, and hundreds of people bought it in the first day. And then 30 days later, 11,000 people had backed the project. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:43	<br><br>
	
And then what the best part is, we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it. So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch, including drinking Listerine. And we actually sent this guy materials. We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man. You're, like, a pro maker." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:59	<br><br>
	
Okay, just wait for this one. This is good. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:08	<br><br>
	
And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums. And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:19	<br><br>
	
And then this brother -- look at this diagram. See where it says "sister"? I love when people put humans on the diagram. I always add humans to any technical -- if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it. And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show, jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides. And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:45	<br><br>
	
And this is fun, and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun? But it's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up, where people can't use computers, necessarily. Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy and he can't use a normal keyboard. And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers. And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web. And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that. We didn't plan for that at all. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:19	<br><br>
	
And then all these professional musicians started using it, like at Coachella, just this weekend Jurassic 5 was using this onstage, and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here, and he put this up last month. And I love the carrot on the turntable. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:35	<br><br>
	
(Music: Massive Attack ― "Teardrop") 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:45	<br><br>
	
And when this started to get serious, I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in, because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change, and governments will be crumbling, and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them. And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:02	<br><br>
	
And as you start to mess around this way, I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with, and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:17	<br><br>
	
And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M&M by accident, you know, maybe that's an M&M surfboard, not an escalator, so don't pick it up right away. Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:32	<br><br>
	
I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff, I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's the world I really want to live in. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:02	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:04	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
0:12	<br><br>
	
嗨，大家好 很有趣，刚才有人提到百战天龙 因为我特别喜欢这节目 七岁时，我用胶带把叉子捆在钻孔机上 然后说：「妈，我要去橄榄园义式餐厅！」 然后--（钻孔声）（笑声） 这装置很适合用在这啊! 这事改变了我的看法， 虽然听起来有点儿傻，但我想，好吧！ 世界的运行的方式是可以改变的 而且我个人就能作些小改变 尤其是我看待周边 那些人造的东西 别人说它们是这样运作的 但我说它们有不同的用法 事隔大概20年后 我还没察觉这想法对我的影响 就到哥斯达黎加去了 在那里和圭米族(Guaymí)相处了一阵子 他们能用摘下来的树叶做成瓦片 也能用树做出床 他们还能─我曾三天都在观察一名妇女 我当场看着她剥棕榈叶 从中抽丝揉合 搓成像绳子一样较粗的线， 然后她把线织在一起 我拿的袋子就是那种材料做的 那三天我目睹了制程 世界运作的方式及现实的实际面 在我脑中因而多少有些头绪 我意识到这袋子及我身上的衣服 还有家里的弹跳床和削笔机 我们手边的东西都是从木石中取材 或加工出土物制成 也许有更复杂的，但方法都一样 于是我不禁思索 是谁决定这些事呢？ 这些是谁造的？怎么做到的呢？ 为何我们后来不做了呢？ 好像现实就是如此形成的 所以我便立刻着手，当时在MIT的媒体实验室 我正在研究研究「创客运动」 还有创客和创造力 因见识过圭米族人在大自然中的能耐 且似乎比较没阻碍，我便从那开始 我到佛蒙特州的「自学营」(Not Back to School Camp) 那里自主学习的学生自己找事做 并且愿意尝试任何事 我就说：「咱们去溪边的树林吧 把东西组合在一起作点什么 任何形状都行，从身边就地取材就好， 咱们什么都不带。」 这对成人和青少年都很容易 也就几分钟而已 就有人在溪流底下做出一个三角形 还有许多小片橡树叶 组成的橡树叶 一片用草绑在树枝上的叶子 把东西插入蘑菇，观察其承载量 以此检验其的肉质、组织和物质特性 45分钟之后，成果变得更精巧了 像以色阶排列叶子呈现色差 并围成一个花环 制作的男同学说: 「这是火，我把它叫做火」 有人问他，「你是怎么把树枝 固定在这树上的？ 他说道：“我o慕馐停但我可以做给你看。」 我说：「哇，那真是不可思议。」 他不会解释，但能示范 会操作且凭直觉就行 但有时候我们的知识反成成为了我们的局限 减低了本有的可能性 对所有人造物而言尤其如此 我们自认已明白事物如何运作 因此很难想象其他可能 正因为我们知道常态 因此不太会假设其它可能 不过小孩子比较没这种困扰 我儿子就是如此，我给他这本书 我是个不错的嬉皮老爹 我对他说：「好!你要学着爱月亮(书名) 我会给你一些像仙人掌的积木 而不是那种方方正正的 而这没什么好奇怪的」 但他不很明白要拿积木做什么 我没示范给他看 所以他想，「恩，我姑且乱试」 这跟刚才提过的自学少年与树枝一样 先试着拼凑形状 然后再进一步尝试其他的 他不久便做出这个机关 可任意把东西弹射出去 然后他要我们帮他 从那时起我就在想 我们可以给人们什么样的工具 特别是懂很多的成人 好让他们明白，世界并非一成不变 所以在日常生活中 自己就能促成改变 其实最伟大的科学家 就有点像是在改变这世界 还有物质的功能 最前卫的艺术家则以不同方式表达 复杂的事情 不管你是厨师、木匠，还是抚养孩子－－ 任何复杂的事情DD 都会出现当下无法解决的问题 你没法做好，除非你这样告诉自己： 「好吧！我们必须要换个角度想。 铅笔原本的书写功能对我不重要 对我而言另有用途。」 让我示范给你们看 就在这有小型的钢琴电路板 这是一支普通的笔刷 我把两者结合在一起（哔哔声） 再加上点西红柿酱 D（乐音）D 然后就可以...... DD（颤音）DD （笑声）（掌声） 那很酷，对吧？ 但酷的不是这个 其他人用你给的电路板 所作的发挥才是最棒的 铅笔不仅仅是铅笔 看看里面有什么 有一根电线从中贯穿 这根电线可不简单 如果把钢琴电路板 钉上铅笔笔身 就可在纸上规划电路 让电流通过。 只需把一小片钢琴电路板钉上 你就可改造铅笔 人体也能导电 拆下铅笔上的钢琴电路板 就能当场制作这样的刷子 只需连接刷毛 湿毛刷可导电 人体也是 皮料是不错的画布 然后你就可连接所有东西了 甚至是厨房的水槽 水槽的金属部分是导电的 水流就像特雷门(theremin)或小提琴的琴弦 （乐音） 你甚至可连到树上 世上万物不外导体和绝缘体 你大可并用 所以D（笑声）D 我把这装置介绍给那群自学少年 因为他们很棒，我不试的他们都会做做看 在脸部搞花样就是我望尘莫及的 这个女孩做了一个「呼啦圈」 当呼啦圈绕着她转动时 她衣服上贴有线路 就在画面中她指的地方 因此每次呼啦圈贴着她身体转 就会让两张铜片彼此接触 依序播出不同的声音 这样的过程将不断重复 我在各地办过这样的工作坊 在台湾的一间美术馆里，这位12岁的女孩 用当地蕈菇、绝缘胶带和热熔胶 作出了菌菇风琴 专业设计师融合这种线路 创造出各种工艺品 大公司如英特尔 小设计公司如Ideo或Bump这样的新公司 都邀请我办这样的工作坊 让电子科技融合日常用品的想法 得以付诸实践 然后我们想到这个点子 除了电器用品外 也把电脑与生活用品结合 看看结果如何 让我很快地演示一下 这是MaKey MaKey电路板 我来架设给你们看 接上USB就可以用了 再连上前进键 大家面朝那，那我就连这个 我再把地线接上 如果按这片披萨饼 刚才放过的幻灯片就会翻页 如果我把这条线接到左箭头键 变换连接点有点像是作设定 有了左右箭头键 就应该能翻页了 下一页，上一页，棒极了！ 然后我们想到要有相关的录像 因为除了我和另一个人 没人觉得这有意义或有甚么重要性 所以我们拍了录像 证明可发挥之处不少 你可以用培乐多(彩泥)大概捏一下 照互联网上控制器的样子去做 只要普通的彩泥，不需特别的东西 而且操纵杆真的可以用画的 执行计算机的小精灵游戏，接上去就行了（游戏音效） Target(商店)卖的那种小塑料抽屉 如果用上的话，用来盛水挺适合的 但也可能会割断脚趾 所以要小心 《幸福计划》一书中的专家 设计了钢琴阶梯，是不是很棒？ 我觉得酷毙了！ 但我们应该自己试一下 世界的规则不应只靠一群专家来规划 大家都该加入 一起改变世界的运作 铝箔纸，还有大家都养过的猫 准备一盆水，你的苹果电脑就成了照相屋 鼠标移到「拍摄」钮 俨然就成了迷你小猫照相屋 我们需要很多人来购买 否则就不能推向市场 于是我们在Kickstarter网站推出 第一天就有数百人购买 30天后 有一万一千人支持这计划 而最棒的是此后 许多人发来充满奇想的视频 以吃午餐演奏美国国歌 还喝漱口水 所以我们提供这家伙素材 意思是，「伙计，我们赞助你。 你简直就是专业的客。」 待会儿有一段很精彩 （笑声） （掌声） 这家伙在科学探索馆内 把室内植物当鼓来敲 父女用特别的方法连接线路 这老兄……看看这张图 看到写着「妹妹」的地方没? 我喜欢包含「人」的图表 我始终让科技结合人的因素 如果你要画工程图，把人加进去 这孩子很可爱，他为妹妹做了弹跳床冒险的幻灯 好让她在生日那天成为焦点 在弹跳床上跳动就能翻动幻灯 这位仁兄集合宠物形成狗钢琴 这很逗趣 有什么比生动有趣更有用呢？ 但这也有严肃的一面 因为有「可得性」的问题 有些人无法使用计算机 一个爸爸写信给我们，他儿子是脑性麻痹 不m用普通键盘 他也买不起 定制的控制设备 他打算用MaKey MaKey 作一种手套让鹤由贤 引起有P「可得性」的热烈讨论 对此我们感到非常d^ 这完全出乎意料 后来一些专业音乐人也青睐 比如本周末的科切拉音乐节(the Coachella Festival) Jurassic 5 也用它来表演 这位来自附近布鲁克林区的DJ 上个月做了这个表演 我颇欣赏那根转盘上的胡萝卜 （音乐：大举进攻乐队DD“眼泪”） 大多数人都没法这样玩(弹)食物（笑声） 因为人们太过投入 我想最好在包装盒上放上严正警告 否则人们得到产品后 将热衷创新改变 政府就会崩坏 之前没提过，因此应警告使用者 但也暗藏惊喜，当你打开盒盖 会看到这句:「世界就是一套创造工具箱」 当你开始随兴摸索 我想你会渐渐明白 你的日常生活 有点像是你展现自我的方式 彷佛酝酿世界的未来 你也能参与其中 那么下一次坐电扶梯时 若无意掉落一粒M&M巧克力 也许看到的会是M&M冲浪板，不是电扶梯 所以不要急着捡起来 也许掏出口袋里的其他东西 扔下去，比如润唇膏之类的 我曾想要筹划一个乌托邦社会 或是完美世界之类的 但随年纪增长 接触了这些事物之后 我现在知道心目中的完美世界 确实无法独力完成 恐怕一百万个专家也不行 这要7亿双 由热情推动的手 分别在自家后院 或是厨房内 共同拼贴出这个世界的样貌 而那就是我向往的世界 谢谢大家 （掌声） 	<br><br>

We have personal computing, why not personal biotech? That’s the question biologist Ellen Jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening Genspace, a nonprofit DIYbio lab in Brooklyn devoted to citizen science, where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology. Far from being a sinister Frankenstein's lab (as some imagined it), Genspace offers a long list of fun, creative and practical uses for DIYbio. 	<br><br>

It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter) Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper. By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros. Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector. It has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:50	<br><br>
	
So who gets to do it? I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it. But what about that guy? (Laughter) (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:06	<br><br>
	
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio. It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs. The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate, it could really stimulate innovation. Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are. And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff, do it hands-on? I thought so. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:05	<br><br>
	
So, three years ago, I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace. It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab in Brooklyn, New York, and the idea was people could come, they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open, friendly atmosphere. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:27	<br><br>
	
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess? The press started calling us. And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy, the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein, and as a result, for the next six months, when you Googled my name, instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this. ["Am I a biohazard?"] (Laughter) It was pretty depressing. The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were. They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did, more regulations, less resources. But now, three years later, here's where we stand. It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces, and this is just the beginning. These are some of the biggest ones, and there are others opening every day. There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:42	<br><br>
	
Let me take you on a little tour. Biohackers work alone. We work in groups, in big cities ― (Laughter) ― and in small villages. We reverse engineer lab equipment. We genetically engineer bacteria. We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life. We like to build things. Then we like to take things apart. We make things grow. We make things glow. And we make cells dance. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff. I'm not going to minimize those concerns. Any powerful technology is inherently dual use, and, you know, you get something like synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology, it really compels you, you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups, because they have better infrastructure, they have better facilities, and they have access to pathogens. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:07	<br><br>
	
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world, America, Europe, got together last year, and we hammered out a common code of ethics. That's a lot more than conventional science has done. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:46	<br><br>
	
Now, we follow state and local regulations. We dispose of our waste properly, we follow safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens. You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry. And sometimes people ask me, "Well, what about an accident?" Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk. I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project. It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study, they're going to take my entire genomic sequence, all of my medical information, and my identity, and they're going to post it online for everyone to see. There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion. The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter) But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:15	<br><br>
	
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?" Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?" So this stuff is just beginning. We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg. Let me show you what you could do right now. A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street? (Laughter) (Applause) Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva, identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner. (Laughter) (Applause) I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard. Looked like a ladybug, right? It actually is a Japanese beetle. And the same kind of technology -- it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's. In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome for mutations. You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's, and you can explore your ancestry. You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there. You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water. You can make some sort of a biofuel cell. You can do a lot of things. You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective. It's really cool. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:04	<br><br>
	
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved? I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science. The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else. There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible. It just has to follow safety guidelines. If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech. It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing. Why not personal biotech? If everyone in this room got involved, who knows what we could do? This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn, you ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:15	<br><br>
	
时下，当一名分子生物学家真是太美妙了（笑声） 读写DNA密码越来越简单 也越来便宜 今年底，我们就能 在不到一天的时间里 排列出你体内基因组内包含的三百万比特的信息 而这只花不到1000欧元 生物科技可能是整个科技领域 最强大，发展最快的一个分支 它极有可能 取代化石燃料 彻底革新医学药品 影响我们日常生活的方方面面 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:50	<br><br>
	
那么谁会让这些成为现实呢？ 我觉得可能我们比较愿意 让这个人来做 那这个人 如何？（笑声） （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:06	<br><br>
	
2009年，我第一次听说“DIY(自己动手)生物学” 这是一场旨在 让每个人都能接触生物科技的运动 而不仅仅是科学家和政府实验室的工作人员 这一运动的理念在于，如果你真正开放科学探索 并让各行各业的人参与进来 将会激发真正的创新 让最终消费者去接触科技 是一个很好的想法，因为他们最清楚 自己的需求是什么 当一些复杂难懂的科技 出现在市面上，并引发相关的 社会、道德、伦理问题 科学家们只能不厌其烦地向公众解释 我们在这样的实验室里已经做过的事情 如果 你家附近有个地方 可以了解这些东西 还能亲身实践，不是很好吗？ 我觉得这样很好 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:05	<br><br>
	
所以，三年前我 同一些有类似想法的朋友一起 建立了Genspace 它是个非营利社区性质的生物科技实验室 位于纽约布鲁克林 它的理念是人们可以过来 在开放友好的气氛中 上上课，在实验室里做些小实验 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:27	<br><br>
	
我之前所有的经历 都不足以让我预知接下来发生了什么。你能猜得到吗？ 媒体开始给我们打电话 我们想谈提高科学素质是多么好的一件事 而他们却想谈 我们将会创造出下一个科学怪人（小说《弗兰肯斯坦》：主人公成功地创造出人工生命，但最终与其同归与尽） 结果，接下来的半年里 在Google上搜索我名字的时候 搜到的不是我的科技论文 而是[“我是个生化危机源”？] （笑声） 我特别沮丧 支撑着我们挺过那段时期的唯一的东西 就是我们知道，在世界的其他地方 也有人试着 在做跟我们一样的事情 这就是早期的生物黑客 他们中一些人面临着比我们更大的压力 更多的限制和更少的资源 但如今，三年后，我们已经发展成这样 （Genspace）成为了一个生机勃勃的全球生物黑客社区 而这仅仅只是个开始 这些只是稍大型的黑客空间 每天都有其他的在新开放 在莫斯科可能会开放一个 在韩国也会有一个 有意思的是它们每一个 都有自己独特的特色 这种特色根植于本土社区 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:42	<br><br>
	
让我带着大家看一看 独自工作的生物黑客 一起工作的 在大城市（笑声） 小村庄 设计工程实验室设备 用遗传基因的方法制造细菌 我们发掘研究硬件 软件 湿件（计算机专家用语, 指软件、硬件以外的"件", 即人脑） 当然还有生命的密码 我们喜欢造东西 又喜欢拆东西 我们让生物生长 让物体发光 让细胞跳舞 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
这些实验室的氛围是开放的，积极的 但你知道，有时人们想到我们 第一个念头就是生物安全 以及其它黑暗的方面 我不会试着去打消这些顾虑 因为任何强大科技的作用，生来都是两面性的 如果你对 合成生物学，纳米生物科技这种东西 真正感兴趣，就必须 同时关注相关业余爱好群体和专业人士 因为他们（专业人士）有更好的基础设施 更好的设备 也能直接接触病原体 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:07	<br><br>
	
联合国就是这样做的。最近 他们就整个生物科技领域发布了一份报告 并得出结论，这种科技的影响 积极意义要远远大于消极意义 他们还特意强调了DIY生物学这一领域 指出媒体一直有一种 高估我们的能力 而低估我们的道德水准的倾向 事实上，来自世界各地 包括美洲，欧洲的DIY生物学家去年已经在去年 共同敲定了我们的道德准则 而传统科学却没有做到这一点 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:46	<br><br>
	
我们遵循国家和地区的规定 合理处置废料垃圾 遵守安全细则，不使用病原体 如果你使用了病原体 你就不是生物黑客社区的一份子 你就是生物恐怖分子社区的成员，抱歉 有时候有人问我 "那么万一发生事故怎么办？" 我可以这样说，使用常规安全的生物体 事故发生的几率 就像不小心创造出 某种超级细菌一样 就同一场暴雪 降临在沙哈拉沙漠正中一样小 它确实有可能发生 但我不打算为这种事担扰 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:30	<br><br>
	
我实际上准备冒另一种“风险” 我签署了一个叫Personal Genome(个人基因)的项目 它是一项在哈佛大学进行的项目， 研究结束后，我所有的基因序列 医疗信息，个人身份 都会由他们公布在网络上，所有人都能看到 在知情同意环节时 他们谈论了很多可能遇到的风险 我最喜欢的一个是 有人下载了我们基因序列，回到实验室 合成一个假Ellen的DNA 然后放在一个犯罪现场里（笑声） 但像DIY生物学一样，我相信它正面的结果 以及为带来研究的益处 还是超过了风险 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:15	<br><br>
	
也许你会自问 “在生物实验室我都能做些什么？” 不久前类似的问题也有过 “人们用电脑都能做些什么？” 所以，这仅仅是个开始 我们只是瞥见了DNA的冰山一角 让我告诉你你现在能做些什么 一位德国的生物黑客，也是个记者，他想知道 谁家的狗在他家附近的街道上留下了“小礼物” （笑声）（掌声） 你们猜对了！他向 所有邻居家的狗扔网球，分析唾液成分 找到了那只狗，并向主人说明了情况 （笑声）（掌声） 我在我家后院发现了一只“入侵物种” 看上去像只瓢虫，是吗？ 其实是只日本金龟子 同样的 这种叫做DNA条形码的技术，真的很酷-- 你可以通过它确认你吃的是不是真正的白鲟鱼鱼子酱 是不是真的金枪鱼寿司，或者 你花了大价钱买到的山羊乳干酪是不是真的山羊乳 作为一名生物黑客 你可以分析你有没有基因上的变异 你可以分析你早餐麦片里的转基因成分 你还可以探索你的祖先，血统 把气象气球发送到平流层 采集微生物，看看里面有什么 你可以用酵母当做生物传感器 来检测水污染 合成某种生物燃料细胞 你可以做无数的事情 你还可以进行艺术科学项目 有些项目真的很赞 从完全不同的角度审视社会和生态问题 真的很酷 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:04	<br><br>
	
有人会问，为什么我要参与这种事儿？ 我可以在主流科学行业里有很好的工作 问题关键是，在这样的实验室里 有些东西是你在别处找不到的 有些东西是你在别处找不到的 黑客空间有好的一面，就是 你可以开展项目 而无须向任何人解释“它会带来丰厚的利润” 无须向任何人解释“它会拯救人类”，甚至“它能够行得通” 只要遵循安全规定（操作项目） 如果在世界各地都有这样的地方 那将会真正改变人们对于 “谁才有资格接触生物科技”这一问题的观念 就是这样的地方，推动了个人电脑的应用和传播 所以为什么不能让个人生物科技也如此呢？ 如果在场的每个人都参与进来 谁都想象不到我们能够做到什么 这是个全新的领域，正如刚才提到布鲁克林时我讲到的 还有更厉害的呢。（笑声） （掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Israel and Iran: A love story?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Ronny Edry	<br><br>
	
   Dec 2012 	<br><br>
	
	
When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent, Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message: "Iranians ... we [heart] you." Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message ― and Iranians responded in kind. The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like "Israel loves Iran," "Iran loves Israel" and even "Palestine loves Israel." 	<br><br>
	
	
Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:15	<br><br>
	
On March 14, this year, I posted this poster on Facebook. This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag. I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:32	<br><br>
	
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store, and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other, and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel. And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel. We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now, and we have people, you know, afraid. It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran. It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever, for 10 years now. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:19	<br><br>
	
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day. So I went to sleep, and that was it for me. And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before. (Laughter) And I was like, "What's going on?" So I come to the computer and I start looking on, and suddenly I see many people talking to me, most of them I don't know, and a few of them from Iran, which is -- What? Because you have to understand, in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran. We don't know people from Iran. It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from -- it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook. And now people from Iran are talking to me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come, because they don't have a computer, she asked her family to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:45	<br><br>
	
So I'm like, whoa. I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that. People are crying, and she came, she read the text, and she started to cry. And everybody's crying now. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what I'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started. The day after, when really it became a lot of talking, I said to myself, and my wife said to me, I also want a poster, so this is her. (Laughter) Because it's working, put me in a poster now. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:27	<br><br>
	
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work, but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel who want to say something. So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:39	<br><br>
	
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster. And that's how it started. And that's how, really, it's unleashed, because suddenly people from Facebook, friends and others, just understand that they can be part of it. It's not just one dude making one poster, it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it. Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too." It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense. I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends to come, graphic designers most of them, to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time. It was a huge amount of pictures. So for a few days, that's how my living room was. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran. And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images. If it's an image, they may read it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
So here are a few of them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!") 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:54	<br><br>
	
("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning, and now that she sees the posters that we're sending, she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:28	<br><br>
	
The day after, Iranians started to respond with their own posters. They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter) Crazy, crazy. So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces, but they want to spread the message. They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. So. And now it's communication. It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message, one to each other. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.") 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
This never happened before, and this is two people supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war, and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say, "I like this guy. I love those guys." And it became really big at some point. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
And then it became news. Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news. And suddenly, there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news, they say, "Okay, let's talk about this." And they just came, and it was so much, 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:33	<br><br>
	
I remember one day, Michal, she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him, "Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:42	<br><br>
	
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel? Who is everybody?""Everybody." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:50	<br><br>
	
They said, "Syria?" "Syria." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:52	<br><br>
	
Lebanon?"Lebanon. At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today. It's everybody." The Chinese. And we were just at the beginning of the story. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
Something crazy also happened. Every time a country started talking about it, like Germany, America, wherever, a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories, so at the beginning we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran? I give you Iran-Loves-Israel." You have Palestine-Loves-Israel. You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago. And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message, to people sending their love, one to each other. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:48	<br><br>
	
The moment I really understood that something was happening, a friend of mine told me, "Google the word 'Israel.'" And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran." We really changed how people see the Middle East. Because you're not in the Middle East. You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East, so you go on Google and you say, "Israel," and they give you the bad stuff. And for a few days you got those images. Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know, commented on one of the photos. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:35	<br><br>
	
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images. We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us. They see images of us, and they see bad images. So we're working on making good images. End of story. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:00	<br><br>
	
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page. This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page. This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. This is the enemy. What? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:22	<br><br>
	
("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria") 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
And it's going both ways. It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other. And we're understanding. And you show compassion. And you become friends. And at some point, you become friends on Facebook, and you become friends in life. You can go and travel and meet people. And I was in Munich a few weeks ago. I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe, I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland, from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came, and we just met there for the first time in real life. I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball. And that was the end of it. Remember that image from the beginning? At some point we met in real life, and we became friends. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:35	<br><br>
	
And it goes the other way around. Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:06	<br><br>
	
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher, so we start this new campaign called "Not ready to die in your war." I mean, it's plus/minus the same message, but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it. And again, something amazing happened, something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you." Just read where those guys are from. And for every guy from Israel, you've got someone from Iran. Just people sending their pictures. Crazy, yes? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:28	<br><br>
	
So -- (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
So you may ask yourself, who is this dude? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:46	<br><br>
	
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli, I'm a father of two, I'm a husband, and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design. And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but, this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean ― " 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:09	<br><br>
	
I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years, and I know how it looks from the ground. I know how it can look really bad. So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late. And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes, but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it. Maybe as people, because especially in Israel, we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech, and maybe that little thing can change something. And really, we can be our own ambassadors. We can just send a message and hope for the best. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:01	<br><br>
	
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images. And maybe that image will help us change something. Just raise that. Exactly. And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:31	<br><br>
	
Oh my God. Don't cry. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:36	<br><br>
	
Thank you guys. (Applause) 	<br><br>

今年3月14日 我在Facebook上发了这张海报 一张我和女儿的相片 （海报上写着：伊朗的朋友们， 我们爱你们） 她手里拿着一面以色列国旗 让我来解释一下是什么事情促使我做这张海报 和我在什么样时候贴出这张海报的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:32	<br><br>
	
几天前我在一家杂货店 坐着排队 当时杂货店的老板和一名顾客 正在闲聊 老板对顾客说 以色列迟早将会遭受一万枚导弹的轰炸 顾客说：不，是每天一万枚 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
("一万枚导弹") 这就是这张海报的来由 这就是以色列的现状 十年来 我们和伊朗之间的战争阴云一直驱之不散 这让人们的心中充满了...恐惧 这些年我们总觉得如果我们不为和平作一些努力 战争将会一触即发 我们总觉得如果我们现在不采取行动 我们将追悔莫及 这种状况已经持续了整整10年了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:19	<br><br>
	
他们的对话触动了我 我是一个平面设计师 所以我设计了一些呼吁和平的海报 刚才你们看到的就是其中之一 通常 我做好这些海报后就贴在 Facebook上就完事了 我的朋友的有的喜欢我的海报 有的不喜欢 我大部分的作品都没人喜欢 也没人分享 没人关心 直到有一天 我上完贴后就睡了 想着这些海报只是做给自己看 可到半夜 我醒了过来 我常在半夜醒来 经过电脑时 我看到屏幕上有密密麻麻的红点 要知道 这在我的Facebook 上是从来没有过的情况 （笑声） 我当时的反应是:“什么情况？” 我坐到电脑前看发生了什么 我看到很多留言 他们当中绝大多数人我都不认识 里面竟然有伊朗人 真的太令人难以置信了 因为你要知道 在以色列 我们从不和伊朗人交谈 我们也不认识任何伊朗人 以色列人在 Facebook 上的好友圈子 基本上也就是以色列人 但是现在我竟然在和伊朗人对话 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
于是 我和这名伊朗女孩交谈起来 她告诉我 她看到海报之后叫全家人一起看了 因为她们家只有一台电脑 看完后一家人坐在客厅里哭了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:45	<br><br>
	
我当时觉得，“哇，太惊讶了。” 我叫醒妻子 跟她说"你一定要看看这个" 有一家伊朗人被我的海报弄哭了 我妻子看完留言后也哭了 大家全哭了 （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
我有点手足无措 而我作为一名平面设计师， 我的直接反应就是----让别人也看到我刚才所看到的一切 后来, 关注我的海报的人越来越多 并且开始分享转发我的海报 故事就这样开始了 第二天，围绕着该话题的讨论越来越多 我妻子对我说 "也给我做张海报”-----我们的想法不谋而合 瞧 这就是她 （笑声） 我的海报引起了人们的关注 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:27	<br><br>
	
但是细想一下 海报之所以引起关注 不是因为我自己，而是以色列公民 想要表达自己的想法 于是我开始寻找身边愿意上海报的人 给他们拍照 做成海报 放到网络上分享这些海报 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:39	<br><br>
	
所以，我对我的邻居、朋友、学生说 “给我一张照片 我为你制一张海报" 就这样，我们开始做这些海报 可没想到,事情竟一发不可收拾 我Facebook 上的朋友、身边的朋友还有其他人 在意识到他们也可以为此做些事后全参与进来了 这并不是做一张海报的事情 而是人人都可以参与其中 所以他们开始给我发照片 并要求我，“帮我做张海报，贴出来。” “告诉伊朗人我们以色列人爱他们。” 一下子做海报的工作量大得惊人 我收到的照片太多了 所以我请了很多也是做平面设计的朋友 和我一起做海报 因为我实在应付不过来 照片的数量非常巨大 所以 那些天我的客厅就是这个样子的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
我们不仅收到以色列人的海报和照片 我们也收到很多伊朗人的评论和留言 然后 我们将这些留言做成海报贴出来 因为我深知: 人们都喜欢看图片,厌恶阅读文本 如果把留言做成图片，他们可能会去看。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
下面 我们来看一下我们做的一些海报 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
（很高兴认识你！你是我第一个以色列人朋友。我希望我们不要被我们两国愚蠢的政客们操控着去做傻事了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:54	<br><br>
	
（“我喜欢你们以色列国旗上的蓝色，喜欢那个六角星，喜欢这面旗帜。”） 这条评论真的让我很触动，因为这条评论来自于 这是一个在伊朗长大的 每天上学都踩踏着以色列国旗进入校园的小姑娘的留言 而现在她看了我们张贴的海报后 她说这改变了她的看法 她现在喜欢它（以色列国旗）的蓝色和它的六角星 她喜欢这面象征着以色列的旗帜， 她还希望我们能够有机会见面和互访 这些留言是在我贴出第一张海报几天之后留的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:28	<br><br>
	
这张海报贴出后的第二天 伊朗人开始贴出他们自己的海报回应我们 他们也有平面设计师。不是吧？（笑声） 这真是太不可思议了 你能看到他们还比较谨慎，他们没有把脸露出来， 但是他们想要表达他们的想法 他们想回应我们，他们的想法跟我们的是一样的。 现在，对话渠道已经建立起来了。 这是双边对话，以色列人和伊朗人 相互给对方传达了同样内容的信息。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
（“我的以色列朋友们。我不恨你们。我不希望和你们打战。”） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
这种对话在以前是从来没有过的事。我们一直处在战争边缘， 彼此都视对方为敌人 但是突然间他们开始在 Facebook 上相互说 “我喜欢这个人，我喜欢那些人。” 某种意义上这是一个很大的改变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
后来，我们在网上的这些事引起了媒体的关注，成了新闻 因为如果你关注中东，你会发现新闻中充斥着各种负消息 然后突然间，爆出了一条这样正面的消息 所以记者们开始关注 他们说，“嘿! 我们要报导这件事。” 然后记者们就来采访了，很多很多记者 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:33	<br><br>
	
我记得有一天，米哈尔， 记者在采访她。她问记者， “谁会看这条新闻？” “所有人。”记者回答。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:42	<br><br>
	
她又问，“所有巴勒斯坦人？所有以色列人？” “所有人是哪些人？” “就是所有人。”他们回答。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:50	<br><br>
	
“包括叙利亚？” “有叙利亚。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:52	<br><br>
	
“包括黎巴嫩？” “有黎巴嫩。” 过了一会儿，他说，“今天估计有4000万人看你的新闻。” “所有人。” 包括中国人。 而我们的故事才刚刚开始。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
更疯狂的事情还在后头。 当任何一个国家的人开始谈论这个话题时， 无论是德国人，美国人，还是别的国家的人， 他们的Facebook上都会弹出一个有着统一图标 有着相同表达的页面 来看看这张"伊朗爱以色列"海报。一个在德黑兰的伊朗人看到我们的"以色列爱伊朗"后 他说 以色列爱伊朗吗？ 那好，我来做一张“伊朗爱以色列”。 后来，还出现了“巴勒斯坦爱以色列”。 几天之前，又出现了黎巴嫩的版本。 这是 Facebook 上有关这类信息的 网页的列表。 当我看到人们相互表达着他们的爱， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:48	<br><br>
	
那一刻我真正感觉到有些事情正在改变。 我的一个朋友跟我说， “Google一下‘以色列’这个单词” 这些图片就是那一段时间 你在谷歌中搜索“伊朗”或者“以色列” 排在最靠前的搜索结果。 我们真的改变了人们对中东的看法。 由于你们并不住在中东地区 而住在其它地区，当你想要了解中东的时候， 你就会登录Google网站，搜索“以色列”， 然后搜到的都是坏消息。 但是有那么一段时间你看到的是这些正面的图片。 今天浏览“以色列爱伊朗”活动的页面 的人数达到80831人.。而上周超过两百万人 访问了该网页，浏览图片， 发表评论并分享了它们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:35	<br><br>
	
这就是我们过去五个月做的工作， 我、米哈尔、我的几个朋友，每天就只做这些海报。 我们通过制作照片海报 向全世界展示我们的一些转变 照片是世界认识我们的主要方式。 他们看到的照片，基本上都是负面新闻的照片。 所以我们制作正面的照片。在故事的结尾， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:00	<br><br>
	
我们一起来看这幅照片，这是“伊朗爱以色列”版本的， 不是“以色列爱伊朗”版本的。这不是我做的。 这是住在德黑兰的一个伊朗人在以色列 阵亡士兵纪念日那天 将一幅以色列士兵的照片贴在自己的页面上。 那可是敌兵的相片啊！ 怎么会这样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:22	<br><br>
	
（“我们向在保加利亚恐怖袭击中失去至亲的家庭表示诚挚的慰问”） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
这并不是单向的。 我们互相表达对对方的尊重， 我们能理解，你们有热诚 那我们就能成朋友。 过了一段时间，你们成了 Facebook 上的好友， 接着成为生活中的朋友。 你可能去旅行，去拜会他们。 我几周前去了慕尼黑。 我去举办一个关于伊朗的展览会 我在那里见到了 Facebook 上认识的新朋友 他们说:"如果你去欧洲 我也要过来见你，我从法国过来，我从荷兰过来， 我从德国过来，”当然还有以色列的朋友 在慕尼黑我们第一次见到了真实的对方。 我第一次见到了那些曾经被认为是我们的敌人的人。 我们相互握手， 我们一起喝咖啡，聊得很愉快， 我们聊食物和篮球。 这是我们会面结束时的样子。 还记得一开始的那张海报么？ 生命中某个时刻我们相遇，并成为了朋友。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:35	<br><br>
	
又或者我们先在网络上成为朋友，再在现实中相遇。 我在 Facebook 上认识一个女孩 她在伊朗出生、长大，现在住在德国， 从没去过以色列，曾经很害怕以色列人， 因为从小获得的知识就是这样的。 在网上跟一些以色列人聊了几个月之后 她决定到以色列看看。 她坐飞机抵达了本・古里安机场（以色列最大的机场） 然后说，“其实以色列人没那么可怕啊。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:06	<br><br>
	
几周前，局势又变得紧张起来， 于是我们发起了一个的新的运动 叫做“我们不愿刀兵相见” 这个跟之前要传达的信息没有太大的差别， 但是我们这次想要表现的更加的激进一点。 跟之前一样，很多令人惊奇的事情发生了。 并且出现了上次活动没有出现过的奇妙的事情。 来自伊朗的人，在上次的活动中还很小心谨慎地 只是在网上贴出他们自己的脚 和半张脸的相片， 现在他们露了全脸，并且宣布， “OK，没问题，我们加入，让我们一起努力。” 看看这些人来自哪里。 现在我们看到有多少以色列人发贴 就有多少伊朗人跟贴 人们不断地互发相片 太疯狂了，不是么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:28	<br><br>
	
所以 ―― （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
你可能会好奇，做演讲的这个家伙是谁？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:46	<br><br>
	
我叫罗尼・艾德里，41岁，以色列人， 是两个孩子的父亲，米哈尔的丈夫 我是一名平面设计师,也教平面设计课 最后我想澄清一下我并不如人们说的那样很太真。因为有很多时候 人们问我，“想法挺不错的，但是， 你不觉得向敌人抛橄榄枝的做法很幼稚吗?” 我并不这样认为 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:09	<br><br>
	
我曾服过役，在伞兵部队呆过三年时间， 我深知地面上的人看伞兵是什么感受。 我知道感觉可能会非常的糟糕。 所以对我而言，这件事情非常值得去做， 赶在一切都太迟之前，促进相互的了解。 因为有些事情一旦发生了，就没有办法再回头。 有时，战争无法避免，但是有些时候 或许可以用我们的努力来避免。 或许作为一个公民，特别是作为以色列的公民， 因为我们是民主国家，我们有言论自由， 或许一点点的努力，真的能够改变一些事情。 我们每个人都是自己的外交大使。 我们可以发出我们的信息，期待最好的结果。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:01	<br><br>
	
现在我想请我的妻子，马哈尔，到舞台上来， 我俩会跟你们一起合一张影， 因为今天我们讲的全是相片的事 或许这张合影能够帮助我们改变一点什么。 请大家(把手里的心型图片)举高一点，很好,就这样。 我现在要拍一张照片， 我要把它贴到 Facebook 上 放在“以色列爱和平”或类似的分类下。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:31	<br><br>
	
天啊。 不要哭。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:36	<br><br>
	
谢谢你们。 （掌声） 	<br><br>

When most well-intentioned aid workers hear of a problem they think they can fix, they go to work. This, Ernesto Sirolli suggests, is naive. In this funny and impassioned talk, he proposes that the first step is to listen to the people you're trying to help, and tap into their own entrepreneurial spirit. His advice on what works will help any entrepreneur. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:16	<br><br>
	
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not ― (Laughter) -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:46	<br><br>
	
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. And I was distraught. I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. Instead, everything we touched we killed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book, "Ripples from the Zambezi," was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River, and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter) And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter) "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians, "Look how easy agriculture is." When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red, overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:48	<br><br>
	
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:54	<br><br>
	
Why didn't you tell us?"You never asked. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:00	<br><br>
	
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:21	<br><br>
	
You should see the rubbish ― (Applause) -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. You want to read the book, read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, Zambian woman economist. The book was published in 2009. We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. Just go and read her book. Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. The two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." But they mean two different things. Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much." Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
I was given a slap in the face reading a book, "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. This should be the first principle of aid. The first principle of aid is respect. This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:28	<br><br>
	
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. So what you do -- you shut up. You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people. We don't work from offices. We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. We have zero infrastructure. And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wants to do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:26	<br><br>
	
The most important thing is passion. You can give somebody an idea. If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do? The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. And then we help them to go and find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone. The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meetings. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:19	<br><br>
	
Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never come, and they never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified. So planning has this blind spot. The smartest people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meetings. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:00	<br><br>
	
What we do, we work one-on-one, and to work one-on-one, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. You have to create a new profession. The profession is the family doctor of enterprise, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:29	<br><br>
	
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first client, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth, to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that? How can you do ― ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult. I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:48	<br><br>
	
So ― (Applause) ― So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter) We've done it in 300 communities around the world. We have helped to start 40,000 businesses. There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:12	<br><br>
	
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died age 96, a few years ago. Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Drucker says: "Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy." Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. 	<br><br>

So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion? Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning? Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:32	<br><br>
	
So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable. The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. What we have to look at is at how we feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. The technologies do not exist to do that. Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it! Government? Forget about it! It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:31	<br><br>
	
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many, many years ago. There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860. And in 1860, this group of people came together, and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was unanimous: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years. Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter) So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:01	<br><br>
	
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. First, you have to offer them confidentiality. Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated, passionate service to them. And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be capable of doing three things beautifully: The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have fantastic marketing, and you have to have tremendous financial management. Guess what? We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. It doesn't exist. This person has never been born. We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None were started by one person. Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography, and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline, in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word "I" and how many times he uses the word "we." Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. He wasn't alone when he started. Nobody started a company alone. No one. So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? What can you do? Can you make it? Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" "Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?" We activate communities. We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people. 	<br><br>

Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>

我所做的一切，不论是生活上还是工作上 我的整个人生--深深受到 年轻时在非洲工作的那七年的影响， 从1971年到1977年。 我看起来很年轻，但其实我老了--（笑声） 我曾在赞比亚，肯尼亚，象牙海岸，阿尔及利亚，索马里 参与过不少与非洲各国的技术合作项目。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:46	<br><br>
	
当时我在一家意大利非政府组织工作。 我们在非洲建立的每一个项目， 都失败了。 我都快抓狂了。 那时21岁的我觉得我们意大利人是大好人， 我们在为非洲做好事谋福利。 然而，我们干什么赔什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
我们第一个项目给了我写第一本书的灵感， 书名叫《赞比西河的涟漪》。 在这个项目中，我们意大利人 决定教赞比亚人种粮食。 所以，我们带着意大利的种子来到了赞比亚南部， 一个壮丽迷人的山谷， 通向赞比西河。 我们教当地人种植意大利西红柿 和西葫芦等等。 当然，当地人对此表示毫无兴趣， 所以我们付工资请他们来劳作， 他们也是一会儿来一会儿不来的。（笑声） 有着如此肥沃的山谷，当地人居然不耕种， 我们对此感到十分惊奇。 但我们并没有问他们原因， 而仅仅是感叹道：“幸亏我们来了。”（笑声） “在饥饿的赞比亚人民命悬一线时伸出了援手。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
当然，在非洲种的东西都长得很好。 我们种的西红柿漂亮极了。在意大利，一个西红柿 长这么大。在赞比亚，能长这么大。 这真是难以置信。我们跟赞比亚人说： “看，耕种多容易啊。” 当西红柿成熟了，红彤彤的好看极了， 一夜之间，从赞比西河跑来两百多头河马 把所有西红柿都啃光了。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
我们跟赞比亚人说：“天呐，这些该死的河马！” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:48	<br><br>
	
赞比亚人说：“没错，这就是我们不在这里耕种的原因。”（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:54	<br><br>
	
“你们为什么不早说？” “你又没问过。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:00	<br><br>
	
我本以为只有我们意大利人在非洲栽了跟头， 但当我知道美国人的情况， 英国人的情况，法国人的情况， 当看了他们的所作所为之后， 我为我们在赞比亚的项目感到非常自豪。 因为，我们至少喂饱了河马。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:21	<br><br>
	
你们应该看看这些垃圾--（掌声）-- 你们应该看看我们塞了多少垃圾给 这些满怀信任的非洲人民。 你们可以读读这本书， 叫《致命援助》，作者是丹比萨・莫约， 一位赞比亚女经济学家。 这本书出版于2009年。 我们这些西方援助国在过去50年里 向非洲大陆投入了两万亿美元。 我不打算跟你们细说这笔钱所造成的损害。 你们自己去读读看。 看看以一位非洲女性的眼光，我们所带来的损害有多大。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
我们西方人是帝国主义者，殖民主义者，以及传教士， 我们跟人们打交道的方式只有两种： 一是居高临下（patronize），二是家长做派（paternalistic）。 这两个词来自于拉丁词根“pater”， 意即“父亲”。 但两个词的意思不同。 家长做派意味着我把不同文化背景的人 当成我的孩子对待。“我爱你孩子。” 居高临下意味着我把另一文化背景的人 当做我的仆人对待。 这也就是为什么在非洲白人被称作“老爷”，也就是老板。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
我在读一本书时，如遭当头棒喝， 这本书叫《小即是美》，作者是舒马赫（英国经济学家）， 他说，经济发展最重要的一点是，如果人们 不想让别人帮忙，就随他们去。 这应该是援助的首要原则。 援助的首要原则就是尊重。 今天早上，给这次大会致开幕词的先生 在地上放了一根棍子，说道， “我们能不能--你们能不能想象一座城市 没被新殖民主义侵略吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:28	<br><br>
	
27岁时，我做出一个决定， 只基于人们的需求提供援助。 我创立了一套工作系统，叫“企业梦工厂”。 我们不做创始人， 也不激励任何人，而是为当地人们的 创业热情而服务，为当地人们 找到更好的人生定位。 所以我们要做的--就是闭嘴。 我们走进一个社区时不会将任何想法强加于对方， 而是与当地人坐在一起交流。 我们的工作地点不在办公室。 我们与客户在餐馆和酒吧见面。 我们没有任何基础设施的建设。 我们所做的，是跟他们交朋友， 并发现他们的兴趣和意向。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:26	<br><br>
	
最重要的是热情。 你可以向客户提出你的点子， 但如果对方不感兴趣， 你又有什么办法？ 客户热衷于自我提升的这份热情 才是最重要的。 对方的热情是建立在自我提升的基础上， 这才是最重要的 然后我们帮助他们搜集相关知识和信息， 因为这世上，单丝不成线，独木不成林。 有点子的人未必懂得相关知识， 但我们可以提供支持。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
所以很多年前，我有个想法， 我们为何不能至少有一次做到聆听他们的想法， 而不是把我们的想法强加于他们？ 但这不能以社区会议的形式进行。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:19	<br><br>
	
我告诉你们一个秘密。 社区会议存在一个问题。 企业家们从不出席， 他们绝不会在公众集会上告诉你， 他们打算把钱用在哪儿， 他们窥测到了什么商机。 所以做计划有一个盲区， 你甚至都无从结识社区里最聪明的那些人 因为他们根本不参与你们的公众集会。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:00	<br><br>
	
我们的做法是，与客户一对一， 为了能一对一，我们必须建设 一套前所未有的社会基础设施。 我们必须创造一个全新的职业。 这种职业相当于企业的家庭医生， 这位企业家庭医生，会与你面对面 在你的家里，你的厨房餐桌旁，或是咖啡馆， 帮助你集结资源来将你的创业热情 转换为谋生技能。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:29	<br><br>
	
我在西澳大利亚州的埃斯佩兰斯进行了试验。 那时我在读博士， 努力摒弃那种居高临下的狗屁做法 到了之后只会颐指气使指手划脚。 我在埃斯佩兰斯的第一年 只是出去遛街，在那些日子里， 我有了第一位客户，我帮助了这第一个人。 他是毛利人，在一家车库里做熏鱼。 我教他把鱼卖给珀斯的餐馆， 帮他进行了筹划。然后当地的渔民们跑来跟我说， “你就是那个帮毛利佬卖鱼的人？你能帮帮我们吗？” 我让这五个渔民合伙运作， 不是把美味的金枪鱼以60美分一公斤的低价 卖给奥尔巴尼（美国）的罐头工厂， 而是以15美元一公斤的高价卖给日本做寿司。 接着又有农民跑来跟我说， “嘿，你帮助了他们，能帮帮我们吗？” 一年之内，我做了27个项目， 政府的人跑来问我， “你是怎么办到的？ 你怎么能--？”我答道：“我做了一件很困难的事， 那就是闭上嘴，听他们说。”（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:48	<br><br>
	
所以--（掌声）-- 所以政府的人说：“那接着做。”（笑声） 我们在世界上300个社区开展了这个项目。 我们已帮助建立了40,000家企业。 新一代的创业者们 皆因闭门造车而一事无成。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:12	<br><br>
	
彼得・德鲁克，史上最伟大的管理咨询师之一， 几年前去世了，享年96岁， 彼得・德鲁克在涉足商界之前 是一位哲学教授， 彼得・德鲁克曾说过： “计划其实是与创业型社会 及创业型经济不相容的。” 计划是给创业帮了倒忙。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:45	<br><br>
	
现在，我们重建基督城（新西兰）， 却不知道基督城最聪明的那群人 想如何运用他们自己的钱财和精力。 我们必须学会如何让这些人 给出他们的意见。 我们必须给予他们保密的承诺，并尊重他们的隐私， 我们要擅长为他们提供帮助， 这样他们才会上门，才会纷至沓来。 在一个10,000人的社区里，我们有200个客户。 你能想象一个400,000人的社区， 凝聚了多少智力和热情吗？ 今天上午你们鼓掌最多的演讲来自谁？ 是充满创业热情的当地人。你们为他们鼓掌。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:32	<br><br>
	
所以我想说的是， 创业精神是当今社会的潮流。 当我们处于第一次工业革命的末期时-- 我们使用不可再生矿物燃料，发展制造业-- 但我们忽然意识到这种发展是不可持续的。 内燃机的燃料总有耗尽的一天。 用氟利昂冷藏食物也非长久之计。 我们现在要关心的是我们如何 以一种可持续的发展方式来满足70亿人的 食物、医疗、教育、运输及通信需求。 现有的科技水平尚做不到这一点。 谁能发明这种科技来 实现绿色革命？大学吗？别想了！ 政府吗？别想了！ 是创业者们，是他们正在为之奋斗。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:31	<br><br>
	
许多年前，我在一本未来主义杂志上 看过一篇有趣的文章。 1860年，有一批专家受到邀请 去讨论纽约市的未来是怎样。 那是1860年，这批人聚到一起， 他们都对100年后的纽约市 作出了推断。 他们的结论众口一词： 100年后，纽约市将不复存在。 为什么？因为他们看着图表上的曲线说， 如果人口继续以这种速度增长， 纽约的人们出行 将需要六百万匹马， 而六百万匹马所排泄的粪便 将无法处理。 到时人们将会被马粪淹没。（笑声） 所以1860年，他们认为，这种肮脏的科技 将扼杀纽约的生命。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
那么结果呢？40年之后，1900年， 美利坚合众国有了1,001家 汽车制造商--有1,001家之多。 找到一种新科技取而代之 才是发展的王道， 而停滞不前的小工厂还有很多。 例如密歇根州迪尔伯恩市的福特汽车公司。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:01	<br><br>
	
然而，与创业者打交道有个秘诀。 第一，你要给予他们保密的承诺。 不然他们不会来找你谈的。 然后你要为他们提供专注 而热情的服务。 你要告诉他们创业精神的真谛。 不论是大公司还是小企业， 都能把以下三件事做得很好： 产品质量要过硬， 市场营销要高效， 财务管理要精明。 问题是什么呢？ 这世上从来没有一个人 能同时做好生产、销售以及财务的工作。 这种人不存在。 这样的能人尚未出生。 我们做过调查，对世界上 100家标杆企业进行研究-- 卡内基培训公司，西屋公司，爱迪生公司，福特汽车公司， 以及所有这些新兴产业的公司，如谷歌，雅虎。 世界上所有成功的企业只有一个 共同点，只有一个： 没有一个企业是靠一人之力创建的。 现在我们在诺森伯兰郡（英国） 教授16岁青年们创业学，我们一开始 把理查德・布兰森（英国亿万富翁）自传的前两页给他们看， 这些学生们的任务就是用下划线标出 并统计理查德・布兰森自传前两页中 用了多少次“我”这个字 和用了多少次“我们”这个词。 “我”一次都没有，“我们”用了32次。 他刚起步时并非单枪匹马。 没人能独自创立一个企业。没人。 所以我们可以建立一个社区， 在这个社区里，我们有来自小型企业背景的辅助商 在咖啡馆中、酒吧里为你出谋划策， 我们能为你提供这位满怀抱负的先生 所受到的帮助， 我们会问你：“你需要什么？ 你能做什么？你能生产出来吗？ 你能销售出去吗？你能打理资金吗？” “啊，这个我办不到。”“那要我替你找人帮忙吗？” 我们鼓舞各个社区进行创业。 我们有志愿者团队帮助创业辅助商 为客户集结资源及人力。 我们发现当地人群的智慧 能创造出奇迹 能改变社区的文化和经济， 只要你能好好利用人们这份热情， 这种活力，这种想象力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:57	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Science is for everyone, kids included</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
What do science and play have in common? Neuroscientist Beau Lotto thinks all people (kids included) should participate in science and, through the process of discovery, change perceptions. He's seconded by 12-year-old Amy O'Toole, who, along with 25 of her classmates, published the first peer-reviewed article by schoolchildren, about the Blackawton bees project. It starts: "Once upon a time ... " 	<br><br>
Amy O'Toole and Beau Lotto	<br><br>
  Oct 2012 	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple. All you have to do is read what you see. Right? So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:21	<br><br>
	
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:24	<br><br>
	
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter) If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:38	<br><br>
	
Audience: What are you reading? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:40	<br><br>
	
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there. I said, read what you're seeing. Right? It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right? That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
It's because perception is grounded in our experience. Right? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see what's there, we never see information, we only ever see what was useful to see in the past. All right? Which means, when it comes to perception, we're all like this frog. (Laughter) Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful. (Laughter) (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:34	<br><br>
	
(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:40	<br><br>
	
BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right? But we're talking about perception here, right? And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception. Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before. But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:12	<br><br>
	
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently, and all new perceptions begin in the same way. They begin with a question. The problem with questions is they create uncertainty. Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late. Okay? (Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still. Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill. The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do, because it takes you into uncertainty. And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space. So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right? And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty. They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right? It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:29	<br><br>
	
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty? It's play. Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun. Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility, and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding, and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. Science is not defined by the method section of a paper. It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative. So if you add rules to play, you have a game. That's actually what an experiment is. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
So armed with these two ideas, that science is a way of being and experiments are play, we asked, can anyone become a scientist? And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children? Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
The first step was to ask a question. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it. So we did it anyway. Right? Of course. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:15	<br><br>
	
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right? So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right? She was one of the young people who was involved in this study, and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage, will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right? Now, science and asking questions is about courage. Now she is the personification of courage, because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all. So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause) (Applause) So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:16	<br><br>
	
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think, because we look alike. But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar, since they seem so different from us. So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way. Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us? Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells. But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:13	<br><br>
	
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:27	<br><br>
	
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule. We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow. Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which? What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work. It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers. It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay? So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:37	<br><br>
	
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do ―Student: 5C. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:46	<br><br>
	
BL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:49	<br><br>
	
Student: There's two up there. And three in here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data. They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc. And now we want to share. That's the next step. So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right? So we have to write it up. So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter) The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:16	<br><br>
	
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections: an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion. The introduction says, what's the question and why? Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation? And the discussion is, who cares? Right? That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:31	<br><br>
	
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak. It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence, this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter) The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter) And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter) This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published. So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old. The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al," and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this. "I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter) In other words, it starts off "once upon a time," the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:32	<br><br>
	
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" ― (Laughter) ― "and it certainly deserves wide exposure." Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent. The work would be publishable if done by adults." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:53	<br><br>
	
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor. They say no. So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right, putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters. And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees, and it was published. Okay? (Applause) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:21	<br><br>
	
It took four months to do the science, two years to get it published. (Laughter) Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. What was the feedback like? Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right? It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine. It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal. Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well. And I'll just read one. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:05	<br><br>
	
I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now. What you guys have done is real, true and amazing. Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science. Who else can have these qualities more than children? Please congratulate your children's team from my side. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor. Can I do it on you? (Laughter) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay. Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter) For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter) And you like technology, right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:45	<br><br>
	
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:47	<br><br>
	
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. Now ... (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:57	<br><br>
	
Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right? You have to close your eyes, and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
(Clapping) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:12	<br><br>
	
(Clapping) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
Audience: (Shouts) (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
(Shouts) (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. Everyone over there shout. (Shouts) Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:41	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:45	<br><br>
	
What's the point? The point is what science does for us. Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way. That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:06	<br><br>
	
Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story. So, Amy? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:20	<br><br>
	
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change. But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle, I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject, and that anyone can discover something new. You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:03	<br><br>
	
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:07	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
Beau Lotto:好的，这个游戏非常简单。 你们只要把看到的念出来就好了，好吗？ 好，我接着会倒数，这样我们就可以一起念出来了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:21	<br><br>
	
好，一，二，三！观众：你能读出这个吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:24	<br><br>
	
BL：厉害。那这个呢？一，二，三！ 观众：你不在读这个。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
BL：好吧。一，二，三！（笑声） 如果你是个葡萄牙人。对吧？那这个呢？ 一，二，三！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:38	<br><br>
	
观众：你们在读什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:40	<br><br>
	
BL：你们在读什么？那儿根本没字。 我刚说的是，把你们看到的念出来。对吗？ 它明明写着，“尔门土卖十ム”（笑声）对吗？ 那才是你们本该念出来的。对吧？为什么会这样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:54	<br><br>
	
这是因为感知基于我们的经验。 是吧？大脑从不具意义的信息中提取出意义 也就是说我们从不去看 那里到底是什么，我们从不看信息。 我们只看到过去曾见过的有用信息。 懂了吗？也就是说，说到感知这回事儿…… 我们跟这只青蛙是一样儿一样儿的。 （笑声） 对吧？它在汲取信息。它在产生行为。 这就管用。（笑声） （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:34	<br><br>
	
（视频）男：嗷！嗷！（笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:40	<br><br>
	
BL：而且有时，当事情不按我们想的那样发展， 我们就会不爽，对吗？ 但是我们现在讨论的是感知，对吗？ 并且感知决定了我们的所学所想 决定了我们的信仰，我们的希望，我们的梦想和我们穿的衣裳 坠入爱河，一切都由感知开始。 如果感知基于我们的历史，那就是说 我们只是在对自己之前的所作所为做出反应 但是实际上，这是个天大的问题， 因为怎样我们才能换种方法去看待问题呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:12	<br><br>
	
现在，我想和你们讲个有关换种方法去看的故事， 所有的新感知都以同样的方式开始。 他们由一个提问开始。 提问的问题在于，他们会产生不确定。 不确定可是个坏东西。它是个会变的坏东西。 你要是吃不准那是不是肉食动物，那就晚了。 懂了吗？（笑声） 甚至晕船也是不确定的结果。 对吗？如果你在船上往下走， 你的内耳会告诉你你在移动。你的眼睛， 因为会随着船一起移动，会说我其实站着没动 你的大脑不知如何处理那些信息中的不确定，于是变得难过 问题“为什么？”是你所能做的最危险的事之一， 因为它会给你带来不确定。 然而讽刺的是，我们能够创新的唯一方法， 就是踏入那片不确定。 所以我们如何才能创新呢？幸运的是， 进化已经给了我们一个答案，对吗？ 它使我们能够去解决问题，即使是最难的。 最好的问题往往拥有着最多的不确定。 比如让我们对于曾经深信的真相产生质疑。对吗？ 问一个如“生命是如何开始的”问题这很简单， 或者说”宇宙的外面有什么？“但是去质疑你曾深信的事 则会真正踏入那片不确定。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:29	<br><br>
	
所以进化给出不确定性的答案是什么呢？ 那就是玩乐。 玩不仅仅是一个简单的过程。玩乐的专家会告诉你 这其实是一种存在的方式。 玩乐其实是赞颂不确定性的一种人类活动。 不确定性让玩乐变得好玩起来。 对吗？它会随着变化而改变。对吗？它开启了各种可能。 它是合作的。实际上我们的社会也是如此连结的。 同时它是动机是内在的，也就是说 我们是为了玩而玩。它自己本身便是一种奖赏。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
现在要是你再看看这五种存在方式， 你会发现他们和你成为一名出色科学家 所需的特质是一样的。 科学并没有一纸定义。 它实际上是一种存在方式，它就在这里， 也在所有好玩的东西身上。 所以如果你给玩乐加上规则，你就得到了游戏。 而实验其实就是这样的东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
那么具备了这两条概念， 即，科学是一种存在方式而实验是一种玩乐。 我们问，是不是任何人都能成为一名科学家呢？ 这个问题，去问25名8至10岁的儿童是最好不过了吧？ 因为他们是玩乐的专家。所以我带着我的蜜蜂舞台 去了Devon的一所小学校，而这件事的目的 不只是为了让孩子们用一种不同的方法来看待科学 更是通过这个过程，用不同的方法审视他们自己。对吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
第一步，是提出一个问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
说实话这个研究我们没拿到任何资金支持 因为科学家们说这些小鬼头无法对科学做出有用的贡献， 老师们也说小孩子做不到。 不过不管怎样我们还是做了。对吗？肯定的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:15	<br><br>
	
好，这里是一些提出的提问。我把他们的字体缩小了 所以你们不用费神去读。关键在于孩子们提出的问题中 有五个问题事实上是过去5~15年间科学发表的基础。对吗？ 所以他们在问的问题对于专业的科学家来说 其实至关重要。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
现在，我想与一位有些特别的人共享这舞台。可以吗？ 她是参与了那项研究的年轻人之一， 而且目前她是世界上有过刊物发表的最年轻科学家之一。 现在，一旦她登上了舞台， 她就会成为TED最年轻的演讲者了，对吗？ 科学和提问，是关于勇气的事。 现在，她将成为勇气的化身，因为 她将站在这，向你们娓娓道来。 Amy,可以请你上来吗？（掌声） （掌声） 接下来Amy将同我一起为大家讲述这个名为 ”Blackawton蜜蜂计划“的故事，首先她将告诉大家 他们所想出的问题。接着交给你了，Amy。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:16	<br><br>
	
Amy O'Toole:谢谢您，Beau。 我们曾以为看出人类和猿类的关联是件很简单的事。 我们的思维方式是，因为我们看起来很相像。 但是我们也好奇过有没有可能我们其实 与其他动物也有关联。”人类与蜜蜂有相似点“ 这个想法是不是有些惊人，因为他们看起来与我们如此不同。 于是我们问，会不会人类与蜜蜂 会用相同的方式来解决一个复杂的问题呢？ 说真的，我们很想知道蜜蜂是否能够 用过去习得的经验来改变自己，以适应新环境 所以如果蜜蜂能像我们一样思考呢？ 好吧，这的确挺惊人的，因为我们在讲的是 一个只有一百万脑细胞的昆虫。 不过事实上他们应该拥有这样的能力，并极具意义 因为蜜蜂，无论在一天中的什么时候，无论光线，无论天气， 又或从任意一个角度接触花朵， 都能像我们一样能够辨别一朵花的好坏。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:13	<br><br>
	
BL：所以接下来一步就是设计一个实验， 也就是一个游戏。所以孩子们跑去设计了 这个实验，也就是――这个游戏，所以， Amy,你能跟我们讲讲那个游戏吗？ 还有你们给蜜蜂设置了怎样的难题？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:27	<br><br>
	
AO：我们想出的难题是个”如果-则“规则。 我们要求蜜蜂学会不仅仅是飞向某种特定颜色， 而是飞向形成了特定图案的 特定颜色的花朵。 只有当黄色花朵被蓝色花朵包围， 又或者蓝色花朵被黄色花朵包围时， 他们飞向黄色花朵才能获得奖赏。 现在蜜蜂可以学来解决问题的规律有好几条。 有趣的问题是，哪一条？ 这个实验最激动人心的地方在于，我们， 还有Beau,根本不知道这实验会不会奏效。 这是个全新的实验，过去从没人做过， 包括大人们。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
BL：也包括老师们，对于老师们来说那真是太难了。 对于科学家来说一般进入实验室后就毫无头绪， 因为我们在实验室就是这么干的，但是对于老师来说 到一天结束不知将要发生什么―― 于是我们把任务交给了Dave Strudwick， 也就是这个计划的合作者。 好接着我将讲述关于这个研究更多的细节 因为实际上你可以读到它，但是下一步 是观察。这里是一些学生们 观察时的视频。他们正在记录 蜜蜂往哪飞的数据。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:37	<br><br>
	
（视频）Dave Strudwick: 所以我们要做的是―― 学生：5C 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
Dave Strudwick: 她还在往上飞吗？ 学生：是啊。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
Dave Strudwick: 那你们记录每一只的路线。 学生：Henry，你能给我帮下手吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:46	<br><br>
	
BL:”你能给我帮下手吗，Henry?"牛逼的科学家就是这么说的，对吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:49	<br><br>
	
学生：那儿有两只。 这儿有三只。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
BL：看到了？所以我们得到了我们的观察结果。我们得到了我们的数据。 他们做了简单的数学运算，平均，等等。 然后我们想和大家分享结果。这就是下一步。 于是我们要把这些写下来并且投稿发表。 对吗？所以我们把它写了下来。 所以我们去了，当然啦，去了夜店。（笑声） 左边的那个杯子是我喝的，看到了？（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:16	<br><br>
	
现在，我告诉他们，一份报告由四部分组成： 引言，方法，结论，讨论。 引言就是，问题是什么以及为什么？ 方法就是，你们做了什么？结论就是，观察结果是什么？ 讨论就是，谁关心它？对吗？ 基本上，这就是一份科学报告。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:31	<br><br>
	
所以孩子们给了这些文字，我把他们改成了叙述文， 也就是说这份报告是用孩子的口吻写的。 它不是我写的。是由Amy 和班上的其他学生们一起写的。结果， 这份科学报告的开头是，“从前……”（笑声） 结论部分写着“训练阶段，难题……介样介样介样。”对吗？（笑声） 至于方法，是这么写的，“然后我们把蜜蜂 丢进了冰箱（还做了蜜蜂派），“笑脸。（笑声） 这是一份科学报告。我们要想方设法让它被发表。 这是封面。我们有好多位作者。 基本上每位的年龄都介于八至十岁之间。 第一位作者是Blackawton小学，因为 如果它被参考了，将会变成”Blackawton等人“ 而不是某一个个人。然后我们将它投给了一份公众期刊， 它说了这个。它说了一大堆，不过最重要的是这个， ”我恐怕这份报告在好多方面都无法通过我们的初期质量审查。“（笑声） 换句话说，它以”从前“开头 图是用蜡笔画的，等等。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:32	<br><br>
	
于是我们说，我们会拿来再修改一下的。于是我把它寄给了Dale Purves, 他是国家科学院的一名世界领先的神经科学家， 他说，”这是我所看过的最原汁原味的科学报告了“（笑声） ”它值得被更多人看到。“ 视觉专家Larry Maloney,说”这份报告真是出色过人。 它若是由成人写的话就能被发表了。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:53	<br><br>
	
于是我们做了什么呢？我们又把它寄回给了编辑。 他们还是不给发表。 于是我们请Larry和Natialie Hempel 为科学家的发现写一些情境评估 放在参考里，然后我们把这份报告投给了《生物学通讯》， 它被五位独立评论员审核了， 然后被发表了。（掌声） （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:21	<br><br>
	
这个科学实验只做了四个月， 但要让它发表却花了两年。（笑声） 真是典型的科学，是不是？所以这也让Amy 和她的朋友们成了世界上最年轻的已发表科学家。 那么反响如何呢？ 那是在圣诞前两天发表的， 第一天的下载量就超过三万次， 它成了科研头牌杂志《科学》的编辑之选。 《生物学通讯》开放了它的永久免费共享。 它是这份杂志唯一一份允许免费共享的报告。 去年，它成了《生物学通讯》上下载量第二的报告， 而且不仅仅是科学家们给予了反馈， 老师和大众也给予了反馈。 我来给你们念一个。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:05	<br><br>
	
“我最近读了《Blackawton蜜蜂》。 我不知道用什么词句来形容我现在的心情。 你们所做的，实在，真实而又惊人。 好奇心，兴趣，纯真以及热情 是科学所需最基本也是最重要的品质。 谁能比儿童拥有更多这些品质呢？ 请代我恭喜你们的孩子们。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
我想通过一个物理隐喻来总结今天的演讲。 我能在您身上做这个实验吗？（笑声） 哦对，就是你，来吧。很好。 科学就是冒险，这也是项不可思议的冒险，对吗？（笑声） 对我来说，不是对他。是不是？因为这个实验我们之前只做过一次。（笑声） 你喜欢科技，是吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:45	<br><br>
	
Shimon Schocken：是的，但是我更喜欢我自己。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:47	<br><br>
	
BL：这是个科技的缩影。好了。 现在……（笑声） 好了。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:57	<br><br>
	
我们现在做一些简单的说明，好吗？ 你得闭上你的眼睛，然后指出 我拍手的位置。好吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
（拍手） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:12	<br><br>
	
（拍手） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
好的，那么如果那儿的大家一起喊呢。一二三？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
观众：（大喊） （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
（大喊）（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
太棒了。现在请睁开你的眼睛。我们再来做一次。 那边的观众喊一个。（大喊） 声音是从哪来的？（笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:41	<br><br>
	
非常感谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:45	<br><br>
	
所以重点是什么？重点在于，科学为我们做了什么。 对吗?我们只是机械地对于生活做出反应， 但当我们真的想做什么与众不同的事， 我们便需踏入那片未知。当他睁开双眼后， 他便能以一种全新的方式来看世界。 而这才是科学给我们带来的。它给我们带来了 通过游玩来探索未知的机会，对不对？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:06	<br><br>
	
我认为真正的科学教育，应该是 人皆可言，并且让大家有能力去尽其言， 因此这个短故事最后的发言权，我决定交给Amy。 那么，Amy? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:20	<br><br>
	
AO：这个计划对我来说真的是太刺激了。 因为它让探索发现的过程走进了我们的日常生活， 并且他告诉了我任何人，我是说随便哪个人， 都有潜力去探索发现新事物， 一个小小的问题就可能带出一个巨大的发现。 改变一个人对于某事的想法 可能很容易，也可能很难。 这取决于那个人对于改变怎么看。 但是改变我对于科学的看法 倒是惊人的简单。我们只是玩了一次游戏 然后想了一下如何设置难题， 于是我意识到了，科学不是一个无聊的学科， 它能让每个人去探索发现新事物。 你只需要一个机会。而我的机会则是来自于 Beau和Blackawton蜜蜂计划。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:03	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家。BL：非常感谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:07	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">How art, technology and design inform creative leaders</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
John Maeda, former President of the Rhode Island School of Design, delivers a funny and charming talk that spans a lifetime of work in art, design and technology, concluding with a picture of creative leadership in the future. Watch for demos of Maeda’s earliest work ― and even a computer made of people. 	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
I have to say that I'm very glad to be here. I understand we have over 80 countries here, so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:20	<br><br>
	
In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference. Do you know about the parent-teacher conference? Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child, where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward. Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment where my father, who never takes off from work, he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person, going to school to see his son, how he's doing, and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know, John is good at math and art." And he kind of nodded, you know? The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
And that always stuck with me all my life. Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay? Why? It became a question my entire life, and that's all right, because being good at math meant he bought me a computer, and some of you remember this computer, this was my first computer. Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause) As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter) You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out. It would say you're wrong most of the time. That was the computer we knew. That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however, I learned about the computer at all levels, and after, I went to art school to get away from computers, and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking. And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people. It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment. I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc., and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan. It's a room broken in two halves. I've turned the computer on, and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer. And the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter) She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus. So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter) And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver, where it's XY. (Laughter) It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:02	<br><br>
	
And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really. The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology, design and art, and how they intersect, how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership. And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:27	<br><br>
	
So starting from technology, technology is a wonderful thing. When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing. It could show text and after we waited a bit, we had these things called images. Remember when images were first possible with a computer, those gorgeous, full-color images? And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound. It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer. And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing. Remember that excitement? And then the browser appeared. The browser was great, but the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth. Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible. And then the mobile phone occurred, text, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone, iPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc. You see this little pattern here? We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last 10 or so years, and have looked to design, as we understand most things, and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine. And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
Designers talk about the relationship between form and content, content and form. Now what does that mean? Well, content is the word up there: fear. It's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear. Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful, and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica, it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right? (Laughter) You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts. Fear. So you can see how you change the scale, you change the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently. You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface, like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear! Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny. Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter) Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter) It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause) It just changes the same content. Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart, they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic, and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear. You feel for them. Or you change the typeface to something like this. It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear. I can never get in there. (Laughter) It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free. "Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way. Free bold feels like Mandela free. It's like, yes, I can be free. Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free. It feels great. Or even free spread out, it's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily. And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove, and I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter) So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way. It's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost, like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic. Design does that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:57	<br><br>
	
And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect, and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do. So -- yeah. So I made a lot of work in the '90s. This was a square that responds to sound. People ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter) But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that. We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing. And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?" And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound? So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:46	<br><br>
	
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse. But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white, monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics. It's called "Tap, Type, Write." It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary. It has 10 variations. (Typing noise) (Typing noise) There's a shift. Ten variations. This is, like, spin the letter around. (Typing noises) This is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises) This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a -- Let's see, this is ― I love the French film "The Red Balloon." Great movie, right? I love that movie. So, this is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell) It's peaceful, like that. (Laughter) I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know. It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out. (Laughter) If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say, "Hit G, and it's going to be all right. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art. By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art. You know, when people say, "I don't get art. I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know? It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say, like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great. (Laughter) Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:46	<br><br>
	
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants. You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:01	<br><br>
	
And why do we have this facility? Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal, the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it. At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image. And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better? And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era. And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo, but when he was based in London, he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops, and the game was as such: When we look at an antique we want, we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique, and if it's a good story, we'll buy it. So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup." And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old." (Laughter) "Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old." (Laughter) And he saw, over and over, the antique's value was all about it being old. And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art. People say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media. And he realized, it isn't about old or new. It's about something in between. It isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good. A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at. You see it in all interesting art today, in all interesting businesses today. How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
So art makes questions, and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions. We aren't functioning so easily anymore. We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore. As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people, and it was the best sign ever to say no. It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything." My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure. And also "no love." (Laughter) So that is authoritarianism. And what is that, structurally? It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted. It is now a network instead of a perfect tree. It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
And so today, leaders are faced with how to lead differently, I believe. This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership. What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead? Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes. Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes. A traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to be right. And this frame is important today, in this complex, ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox, and I said great. And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight, six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London, and that was really bad. But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing. You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days. And it felt kind of like being president, actually. I was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?" And by the end of the experience, I realized why I was doing this. It's because leaders, what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen, and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London, and so leadership, connecting people, is the great question today. Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy, it's a wonderful design challenge. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:17	<br><br>
	
And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective. Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually. So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop? This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. There may be different subdivisions in the organization, and you might want to look into different areas. For instance, green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly. You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen? So for instance, you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there, and know that you know someone in Eco, over here, and these people here are in Eco, the people you might engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy. And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas, and so you might look in R&D, and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest, and it's a person important to engage. So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display on how you're interacting with them. How many coffees do you have? How often are you calling them, emailing them? What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out? Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso, the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:55	<br><br>
	
So these kind of systems, I believe, are important. They're targeted social media systems around leaders. And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design, because art and design lets you think like this, find different systems like this, and I've just begun thinking like this, so I'm glad to share that with you. So in closing, I want to thank all of you for your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
非常高兴能来到这里。 我知道大家来自于80多个国家， 在来自于这么多国家的人面前发言， 对我来说是一种全新的体验。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:20	<br><br>
	
我相信，在每个国家， 都有一种叫家长会的东西。 你们知道什么是家长会吗？ 不是作为一个家长，而是当你还是个孩子的时候， 你的父母来到学校， 然后，老师会跟他们进行些有点儿奇怪的谈话。 我记得在我小学三年级的时候， 我的父亲，一个从来不请假休息的人， 一个典型的蓝领，移民工薪阶层， 去学校看他儿子表现得怎么样， 我的老师告诉他，“你知道吗， John擅长数学和艺术"。 他稍稍地点了点头。 第二天，我看到他在跟我们家豆腐店的客人聊天， 他说，"你知道吗，John的数学很好。" （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
这个事情一直都让我困惑不解。 我爸爸为什么不提艺术？为什么擅长艺术就不好？ 为什么呢？它成为了一个我一辈子都在寻找答案的问题， 这也没什么的，因为擅长数学， 他给我买了一台计算机，有些人可能记得这台计算机， 这是我的第一台计算机。 你们谁有过Apple II？用Apple II 的人很酷。（掌声） 就跟你记得的一样，Apple II 什么也做不了。（笑声） 你插上电，开始打字，然后绿色文本就会出来。 大多数情况下它都会说命令错误。 这就是我们以前所接触的计算机。 正是因为这台计算机，我进入了麻省理工学习， 这是父亲的梦想。 在麻省理工，我学习了各个层次的计算机知识， 但在那之后，我却去了艺术学校，以此来逃离计算机， 我开始更多地将计算机看做是 思考的精神空间。 我深受表演艺术的影响， 于是20 年前，我做了一台由人模拟的计算机。 我将其命名为人类动力计算机实验。 我有电源管理人、 鼠标驱动人员、 内存等， 我是在日本的旧首都京都做的这个实验。 那是一个被分成两半的房间。 我开启计算机后， 助理们把一个用纸板做的巨型软盘 放入计算机。 然后那个充当软盘驱动器的人就戴着这个软盘。（笑声） 她访问磁盘上的第一个扇区, 提取数据，然后传递给电脑的主线。 主线会敬业地把数据输入到计算机， 到内存，到CPU，再到VRAM等。 这是一个能运行的计算机，一个传输数据的线路集合，真的。（笑声） 它看起来很快。那是鼠标驱动人员 写着XY。（笑声） 它看起来似乎运行很快，但实际上， 这是一个运行非常慢的计算机， 当我意识到跟正常的计算机相比，它有多慢时， 我对计算机和科技从总体上有了新的思考。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:02	<br><br>
	
所以，我今天真正要谈论的有四件事。 前三件事是关于我是如何一直以来 对科技、设计和艺术都充满了好奇的， 以及这三者是如何重叠、相互影响的。另一个主题 是我成为罗德岛设计学校校长这四年以来 一直在思考的问题：领导力。 我会讲一下我是如何尝试着 把这四个领域结合到一起实现同步并进行试验的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:27	<br><br>
	
从科技开始说， 科技是很美好的事物。 当那个Apple II 问世时，它真的什么都做不了。 它可以显示文本， 一段时间后，它开始显示图像。 还记得当计算机第一次显示图像， 显示那些华丽、 全彩图像的时候吗？ 几年后，CD 音质问世了。 你可以在计算机上听到声音了，这令人难以置信。 然后是 CD-ROM的电影，多么了不起！ 还记得当时那种兴奋的感觉吗？ 然后浏览器出现了，最初的浏览器不错， 但是非常初级，只能执行很简单的任务。 首先是文本，然后有了图像， 一段时间的等待之后，又有了通过网络播放的 CD音质， 然后是出现在互联网上的电影，有点儿难以置信。 然后，手机诞生了， 文本、 图像、 音频、 视频。 现在我们有了能播放文本、 视频、 音频等内容的 iPhone，iPad，Android。 你发现这其中微妙的规律了吗？ 我们看起来像是被困在了这个循环之中， 这种由计算机带来的种种可能性 是我过去10多年以来一直在质疑的。 因为我通过设计来理解大多数事情，所以我们也研究了设计， 通过科技来领会设计也成为了我的一个爱好。 我这里有一个小实验来让你快速了解设计。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
设计师注重于形式与内容， 内容与形式之间的关系。这是什么意思呢？ 内容是屏幕上的字： 恐惧。 一个由四个字母组成的词，是一个描述一种不好的感觉的词。 这个词用浅色Helvetica字体显示， 所以我们并没感到很有压力， 如果设置成非常浅的Helvetica字体， 感觉就像，"哦，恐惧，有什么大不了的呢？ “ 对吧？（笑声） 我们还是用同样浅色的Helvetica字体，但把它放大， 就像，天哪，真吓人！恐惧！ 刚才，我们通过改变字体大小，改变了形式。 尽管内容是相同的，但你的感觉却不一样。 你把字体改成这样的， 这个比较搞笑，有点儿像海盗字体， 像杰克船长（加勒比海盗）字体：啊！恐惧 ！ 这一点也不吓人，实际上还很好笑。 而这种字体，感觉像夜店。（笑声） 让你觉得我们必须得去“”恐惧“喝一杯。（笑声） 很神奇，对吗？（笑声）（掌声） 相同的内容，感觉却不一样。 或者像这样，字母本来是分开的， 但把他们挤在一起， 像是在泰坦尼克号的甲板上， 你就会为这些字母感到难过，似乎是”我感到惧怕“。 你可以感受到他们。 或者，你还可以把字体改为这样。 它非常优雅，就像一家昂贵的叫做”恐惧“餐馆。 我永远都进不去。（笑声） 恐惧，真是了不起。但这就是形式与内容。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
如果你只改变其中的一个字母， 你会得到一个好得多的词：自由。 "自由"是一个很好的词，你可以用任何的方式感受它。 加粗之后，感觉像曼德拉被释放而自由了。 就像”耶，我自由了“。 变浅之后，感觉就像，啊！我可以自由呼吸了。 那感觉真棒。或者把这些字母分开， 这就像，我可以轻松自由地呼吸。 我可以添加蓝色渐变和一只鸽子， 感觉就像Don Draper（广告狂人男主角）那样的自由。（笑声） 所以形式、 内容和设计就是这样运作的。 这很强大，跟魔术差不多， 就像我们在 TED看到的魔术师一样。 设计跟魔法一样， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:57	<br><br>
	
我一直以来都对设计和科技 是如何相互融合的十分感兴趣， 我将展示一些我以前从来没有展示过的作品， 让你们了解我所做的事情。 -- 我在90 年代有很多作品。 这是一个对声音有反应的方块。 人们问我，为什么做这个东西，我也不知道。（笑声） 但是我认为，这个方块能对我做出反应， 感觉很不错，那时候我的孩子们还很小， 他们会玩这些东西， 他们会对着方块喊，"啊！爸爸，啊，啊。” 我们去买电脑的地方时，他们也会这样。 然后他们会问，"爸爸，为什么这些电脑没有回应呢？" 正是从那时候起，我便开始想， 为什么计算机对声音没有反应呢？ 所以我当时就做了一些这种类型的实验。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:46	<br><br>
	
我也花了很多时间 研究交互式图形以及相关的东西，但后来我停下来了， 因为我在麻省的学生比我强多了， 所以我不得不“金盆洗手”。 但在 96年，我制作了我最后一件作品：它是黑白的， 单色，完全单色，完全基于整数数学。 我将其命名为"点，打，写。" 我以此来向老式打字机致敬， 我母亲是位法律秘书，她曾经就在那样的打字机上打字。 它有 10 种变化。(打字声) (打字声) 这是shift。 十种变化，这种是左右转动字母。 (打字声) 这像是一个由字母组成的戒指。(打字声) 这台打字机有20多年的历史了，所以它有点儿 ― ― 看，这是 ― ― 我喜欢法国电影《红气球》。 很棒的电影，对吧？我非常喜欢那部电影。 所以，这就像那部电影的延伸。(打字声)(打字机铃声) 很平静，就像这样。（笑声） 最后一种作品，是有关平衡的。 这种打字方法让人有点抓狂，所以如果你 在这个键盘上打字，你可以让它平衡起来。 （笑声） 如果你按G，什么事儿也没有，所以我总是说， "按G， 一切都会好的。“ 谢谢。（掌声） 谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
这是在 20 年前。 我一直是在艺术的边缘。 在担任了罗德岛艺术学院的校长之后， 我更加深入地了解了艺术， 艺术是非常美妙的，精美艺术，纯艺术。 当有人说"我不懂艺术，我一点儿也不明白"时， 那就意味着艺术影响到你了，知道吗？ 艺术就应该是神秘的，所以当你说"我不明白" 的时候， 其实是在说“哦，太棒了。”（笑声） 这就是艺术的力量，艺术是在提问题， 提那些可能无法解答的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:46	<br><br>
	
在罗德岛设计学院，我们有一个十分出色的实验室 叫埃德娜 ・ 劳伦斯自然实验室，在那里我们有 80,000 种动物、 骨头、 矿物质和植物的样本。 在罗德岛，如果一个动物被撞死了， 就会有人打电话过来，我们会把尸体运过来，填充成标本。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:01	<br><br>
	
我们为什么要有这样的实验室？ 因为在罗德岛设计学院，你需要看到真实的动物， 来感知他的大小，并了解它们。 在罗德岛设计学院，我们是不允许根据图像来画图的。 很多人问我，John，你就不能把这些实物数字化？ 把所有东西都变成电子版，这不是更好吗？ 我常说，我们以前做事的方法是有可取之处的。 而且与众不同， 即使是在新时代， 我们仍然要弄清楚它们好在哪里。 我有一个好朋友，是一位新媒体艺术家 叫做长谷川值，他住在伦敦，不，实际上是在东京， 但是当他住在伦敦时，他和他的妻子经常 玩一个游戏，他们会去古董店， 这个游戏是这样的： 当他们看见一件想要的古董的时候， 会问问老板这件古董背后的故事， 如果是一个很好的故事，他们才会买这件古董。 所以当他们去古董店时，他们会看着这个杯子， 然后问："跟我们讲讲这个杯子。" 老板会说："它是旧的。"（笑声） "还有呢。" "哦，它非常旧。"（笑声） 他反反复复地了解到， 古董的价值便在于它是旧的。 作为一名新媒体艺术家，他感叹道， 我用整个职业生涯来创造新媒体艺术。 人们却会说，"哇，这是什么艺术？“ "这是新媒体。” 他意识到，新媒体无关乎旧或新。 它介于这两者之间。 它不是关于"旧“的泥土，或是"新"的云。 它要寻找什么是好的。 云和泥土的组合才是新媒体。 你会在所有有趣的艺术中， 以及所有令人感兴趣的商业中，看到这种组合。 如何将这两者结合产生好的东西，是非常有意思的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
所以艺术创造问题， 领导力则意味着提出很多问题。 社会不像以前那样单一了。 现在再也不是简单的独裁政权。 举个独裁主义的例子， 我曾经去俄罗斯圣彼得堡的一个国家纪念碑旅游， 我看见一个标志，上面写着，"请勿践踏草坪“ 我想，我是说英语的人， 用英语写标语就像是刻意对我说的，这不公平。 但我发现一个给说俄语的人的标志， 这是有史以来最好的禁止标志。 "禁止游泳，禁止远足，禁止任何事情。" 我最喜欢的一个是"禁止携带植物。 " 为什么会有人带植物到国家纪念碑？我不太明白。 还有"禁止谈情说爱"。（笑声） 这就是独裁主义。 从结构上而言，独裁主义是什么？ 它是一个等级制度。大家都知道， 如今我们都在用等级制度运做很多东西， 但它已经被打破了。 现在它是一个网结构，而不是一个完美的树结构。 它是一个分层结构，而不是等级结构，这有一点奇怪。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:43	<br><br>
	
因此，我认为如今的领导者们面临着 如何以不同的方式来带领团队。 我与我的同事Becky Bermont 研究了创意领导学。 我们从艺术家和设计师那里能学到哪些关于领导力的事情？ 许多的情况下，一般的领导都希望避免错误， 而有创意的人其实喜欢从错误中学习。 传统的领导者总是想要正确， 而创意领导者则只是希望能正确。 这个框架如今很重要，在现在这个复杂，捉摸不透的世界， 我相信艺术家和设计师们可以教我们很多事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
最近我在伦敦有一个展览， 我的朋友邀请我在伦敦呆四天， 就坐在沙坑里，我欣然答应了。 于是那四天我一直坐在沙坑里， 每天六个小时，在伦敦的任何人都可以和我面对面六分钟， 那可真是杯具。 但是，我可以听见人们聊他们的问题， 在沙上画画，试图解决问题， 很难弄清楚我在做什么。 这样一对一的会议，持续了四天。 感觉就像当总统一样，真的。 就像"哦，这是我的工作。我是总统，我有很多会议。" 到最后， 我意识到我做这件事的原因。 这是因为作为领导者， 我们要做的就是建立原本不可能的联系， 并且希望一些事情会发生， 而在那个房间里， 我发现了很多伦敦人之间的联系， 所以用领导力来连接不同的人，是如今的大问题。 无论你是在等级制度下，还是在分层结构中， 这都一个很棒的设计挑战。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:17	<br><br>
	
我一直在研究一种系统， 一种透过艺术与设计的视角， 来结合技术与领导力的系统。 让我向你展示一些我从没展示过的东西。 这是一个草图， 是我在Python 中写的应用，大家知道Photoshop吧？ 这个叫Powershop，而它运作的方式是这样的， 你可以想象一个组织， 在这个组织中，CEO任何时候都不是在最高层。 CEO 总是在这个组织的中心。 组织中也许还有更小的分支机构， 你可能想要了解不同的领域。 例如，绿色代表做得好的领域，红色代表表现不佳的领域。 作为领导者，你如何浏览数据，建立联系， 让事情变得可能？ 例如，你可以点开这个分支，再找到其中不同的分支， 你认识在生态部门的某个人，在这里， 然后 这些在生态部门的人， 可能是你作为 CEO或者管理者想要加强联系的人， 对于CEO而言， 要找到跨越领域的联系是一件很具有挑战性的事。 你可能关注研发部， 在这里，你看到一个跨越两个领域的人。 那么这个人就是一个非常重要的人。 因此，你可能想要仔细地看看 你是如何与他们互动的。 你跟他们喝了多少杯咖啡？ 你多久给他们打一次电话，发一封邮件？ 他们邮件的主题是什么？进展得怎么样？ 领导者也许能用这些系统来 更好地规范被领导者在分层体系中的工作。 你还可以使用类似于Luminoso的技术， 像那些来自剑桥的人一样做深度文本分析。 你沟通的要旨是什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:55	<br><br>
	
我认为，这种类型的系统是很重要的。 它们关注于领导人的社交圈。 我相信这种观点的壮大， 需要更多的领导人介入艺术和设计领域， 因为艺术和设计让你像这样思考， 找到像这样的不同的系统， 而我才刚开始像这样思考， 很高兴能与你们分享。 最后，我想谢谢大家 谢谢你们的关注。非常感谢。（掌声） （掌声） 	<br><br>

The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was 15 years old. I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex. And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way. I went to my school kitchen, and I said, "Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at." I went to the local baker and took their stale bread. I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets. This was great. My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork. I sold that pork to my school friends' parents, and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption, and that I was only scratching the surface, and that right the way up the food supply chain, in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes, in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food. Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting. I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites, and I thought, surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:24	<br><br>
	
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs, I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time. I grabbed hold of it, sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter) That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism, really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste, and the provision of the solution to food waste, which is simply to sit down and eat food, rather than throwing it away. That became, as it were, a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food, and exposing, most importantly, to the public, that when we're talking about food being thrown away, we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about stuff that's beyond the pale. We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
Eventually, I set about writing my book, really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world. Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist, and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted. So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country. That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths. That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste-free world. But that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure, nutritional diet for every person in that country. Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world, represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:33	<br><br>
	
As a country gets richer, it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants, and as you can see, most European and North American countries fall between 150 and 200 percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations. So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:59	<br><br>
	
But the thing that really struck me, when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers, was that you can see how it levels off. Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark, and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising as you might expect. So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false. And that's what I came up with. If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants, but also the food that people feed to livestock, the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products, what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself. A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
When people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 2050, I always think of these graphs. The fact is, we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger. We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before. In many ways, this is a great success story of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago. It is a success story. It has been a success story. But what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear, and when we chop down forests, as we are every day, to grow more and more food, when we extract water from depleting water reserves, when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food, and then we throw away so much of it, we have to think about what we can start saving. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:51	<br><br>
	
And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:09	<br><br>
	
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply, okay? We start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture, whether it's a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization, grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya. Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals, and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat, so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste, what ends up in the garbage, what ends up in supermarket bins, what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two, and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources, especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
Having gone through the data, I then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up. Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff on our plates, but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
Supermarkets are an easy place to start. This is the result of my hobby, which is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter) Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores, we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back, opening up bins and having a look at what's inside. But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America. It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. When you start going up the supply chain, you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
Can I have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house? Who lives in a household where that crust -- that slice at the first and last end of each loaf -- who lives in a household where it does get eaten? Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people, and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world, and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it? (Laughter) I certainly haven't. So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter) This is the answer, unfortunately: 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread. In the same year that I visited this factory, I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies. We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:20	<br><br>
	
Go one step up, and you get to farmers, who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards. This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested, because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it. Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect, all going for pigs. Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications, tomatoes in Tenerife, oranges in Florida, bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year, all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador. All being discarded, perfectly edible, because they're the wrong shape or size. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:01	<br><br>
	
If we do that to fruit and vegetables, you bet we can do it to animals too. Liver, lungs, heads, tails, kidneys, testicles, all of these things which are traditional, delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last 30 years. As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best, or is incinerated. This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China, is serving up his national dish. It's called sheep's organs. It's delicious, it's nutritious, and as I learned when I went to Kashgar, it symbolizes their taboo against food waste. I was sitting in a roadside cafe. A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl, and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl. I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken? How have I insulted my host?" He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter) I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food. This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:06	<br><br>
	
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people, do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale, if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it, tell governments we want to see an end to food waste, we do have the power to bring about that change. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:26	<br><br>
	
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed. In our homes, we've lost touch with food. This is an experiment I did on three lettuces. Who keeps lettuces in their fridge? Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for 10 days. The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference. The one on the right I treated like cut flowers. It's a living organism, cut the slice off, stuck it in a vase of water, it was all right for another two weeks after this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:57	<br><br>
	
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning, will inevitably arise, so the question is, what is the best thing to do with it? I answered that question when I was 15. In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago: We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food. And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. It's unscientific. It's unnecessary. If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe. It's also a massive saving of resources. At the moment, Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America, where its production contributes to global warming, to deforestation, to biodiversity loss, to feed livestock here in Europe. At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them. If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon. If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste, to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity, you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs. We knew that during the war. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally, the quest to tackle food waste. Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009. We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted. Since then, it's happened again in London, it's happening internationally, and across the country. It's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it. For the sake of the planet we live on, for the sake of our children, for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us, we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats. Stop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) 	<br><br>

这项揭露全球粮食浪费丑闻的任务 从我15岁起便开始了。 我买了一些猪。当时我住在萨塞克斯郡。 我开始用最传统 和环保的方式饲养它们。 我去了学校的厨房，我说， “把那些我朋友们所看不上的 残羹剩饭都给我。” 我去了当地的面包店，向他们要了那些不新鲜的面包。 我去了当地的蔬菜水果店，还去找了一个 正在丢弃土豆的农民， 仅仅是因为它们形状和尺寸不符合超市的需求。 一切都很顺利。我养的那些猪把食物残渣 都转变成了美味的猪肉。我把猪肉 卖给学校里朋友们的家长，并且我也从中赚到 额外的零花钱。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
但是后来我意识到，我喂猪所用的大部分食物 都是人类可食用的， 而我也只触到了问题表面， 在整条食物链的最上面， 在超市里，在蔬菜水果店里，在面包店里，在我们的家里， 在工厂和农场里，我们都在大量地、疯狂地浪费着食物。 那些超市的负责人甚至都不愿意跟我讨论 那些他们到底浪费了多少粮食的话题。 我曾经绕到超市的后面。我亲眼目睹了那些装满食物的垃圾桶 被锁在卡车里，然后被送往垃圾场填埋， 然后我就在想，肯定有更合理的处理食物的方法， 而不是浪费它们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:24	<br><br>
	
一天早上，当我正在喂我的猪时， 我看到一块看起来很美味的晒干的西红柿面包， 它们常常会出现。 我抓起了它， 坐了下来，跟我的那些猪共进早餐。（笑声） 这就是我第一次做出这种后来被我称呼为“免费素食主义"的举动， 实际上体现出的是对浪费食物的不满， 并且提供了浪费食物的解决方案， 那就是，坐下来，吃完它， 而不是把它丢掉。 这种行为变成一种对大型产业 浪费食物行为的抵抗， 更重要的是，去向大众揭露， 当我们在说被丢弃的食品时， 我们说的不是腐烂的食品，我们说的不是 那些难以下咽的食物。 我们说的是那些完好的，新鲜的食物 在被大规模地浪费掉。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
终于，我决定写一本书， 来说明这个问题在国际上的广度。 这个显示出的是 世界上每个国家对食物可能的 浪费程度。 但是很可惜，实际、确凿的数据很难统计， 因此，为了证明我的观点，我首先得通过 一些替代的方式来揭露 有多少食物被浪费了。 于是，我把各国的食物供应量 跟其自身的实际消耗量 拿来做比较。 这些数据是基于食物摄入量的调查问卷基础上， 再加上肥胖程度和很多其他不同的因素， 来得出一个大概的 关于究竟有多少食物真正进入了人们的口中的推测。 表格中间的黑线 是食物消耗量的大概数值 当中包括了一定量的无法避免的浪费。 浪费永远都会存在。 我还不至于不切实际到去 以为我们可以生活在一个毫无浪费的世界里。 但是那条黑线显示出 一个具备良好的，稳定的，安全的 有营养的食品的国家应该供应给每个人的食物量。 你会发现，世界上绝大多数的国家 都处于这条线的上方， 代表着不必要的盈余，也反映出 每个国家的食物浪费量。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:33	<br><br>
	
当一个国家变富裕时，它会投入越来越多的资产 来购买大量的、额外的存货 导致商店和餐馆里产生更多的浪费， 同时你可以看到，大多数欧洲 和北美的国家 消耗着150％到200％的 国家总人口营养需求量。 所以一个像美国这样的国家 在它商店货架上和餐馆里所拥有的食物 比实际需要喂饱所有美国人的量还多出一倍。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:59	<br><br>
	
但是当我处理这些大量的数据时， 一件深深震撼我的事就是， 如你所见，数据点逐渐趋于平缓。 各个国家的点很快升至150的标记，而在到达这个界限后 便趋于平稳，而非像你所预期的那样 继续上升。 所以我决定更近一步的解读这些数据 来看这到底是准确的还是错误的。 这就是我所发现的。 如果不仅仅包括是那些最终 流向在商店和餐馆的食物，而且还包括 人们用来饲养牲畜的食物： 那些玉米、大豆、小麦，等等人类本可以食用 但是却选择给牲畜用来增肥 以便制造更多肉类和奶制品， 你会发现，大多数富裕的国家 消耗着它人口所需要的 三到四倍多的食物。 一个像美国这样的国家有着它人口所需要的 四倍的食物。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:52	<br><br>
	
当人们在讨论着需要扩大全球 粮食产量来喂饱2050年之际 预计的全球90亿人口， 我总是会想起这些图表。 实际上，富裕的国家为我们和饥饿之间 提供庞大的缓冲。 我们之前从未有过如此庞大的盈余。 在很多方面，这是一个人类文明的成功的故事： 在农业富余方面 我们达到了12,000年前所定的目标。 这是一个成功的故事。这一直都是一个成功的故事。 但是我们现在要认识到的是我们已经 要达到地球所能承受的生态极限， 每天，当我们砍下一片片树林， 来增加越来越多的食物， 当我们从渐渐耗尽的水资源中提取水， 当我们排放着化石燃料的废气 来增加越来越多的食物， 然后再把这么多的食物都丢弃， 我们必须想一想我们能开始保存下些什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:51	<br><br>
	
昨天，我去了一家我常去的 本地的超市 去察看他们丢弃了些什么。 我找到了很多包饼干 还有很多水果蔬菜和其他的一些东西 都在废弃物之列。 然后我想到，这个可以作为今天的一个象征。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:09	<br><br>
	
所以我想让你们把这9块我在垃圾桶里找到的饼干 想象成全球粮食供应， 好吗？我们最初有9块。 这是全球每年的食物产量。 第一块饼干在我们离开农场之前 就会失去。 这个问题主要与 农业工作发展有关，不管它是 缺乏基础设施，制冷设备，杀菌技术， 以及粮油店，甚至基本的水果箱，这意味着 食物在离开产地之前就会被浪费掉。 下面三块饼干是在我们决定用来 饲养牲畜用的食物：玉米，小麦和大豆。 不幸的是，我们的野兽们是低效的动物们， 它们把2/3都转换成粪便和热量， 因此我们丢失了两块饼干，我们只保留下这一块 代表肉类和奶制品。 还有两块我们会直接丢进垃圾桶里。 这就是我们大多数人所认为的 食物浪费，那些最终到了垃圾桶里的， 最终到了超市的垃圾桶里的， 最终到了餐馆的垃圾桶里的。于是我们又失去了两块， 而我们只为自己留下四块能食用的饼干。 这种利用全球资源的方式并不高效， 特别是当你想起这个世界上有多少亿的人们 正在挨饿着。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
研究过这些数据，我还需要 演示这些食物最终去了那里。 它去了哪里呢？我们习惯于看到那些在我们盘子上的 食物，但是那些在这之前不见的 食物去了哪里呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:34	<br><br>
	
超市是个容易开始着手的地方。 而这是我爱好的结果， 就是非官方的垃圾桶检查。（笑声） 你会想这很奇怪，但是如果我们能靠企业 来告诉我们他们在店里都在做些什么， 我们就不必要偷偷摸摸的跑到店后面， 打开垃圾桶去看里面有什么。 但是这就是你或多或少 能在英国，欧洲和北美的大街小巷里看到的。 这表明了庞大的食物浪费， 但是在写书期间我发现 这些显而易见的大量浪费 其实只是冰山一角。 当你开始从食物供应链往上， 你就会发现庞大规模的食物浪费 正在发生 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:19	<br><br>
	
我想让在座的各位来次举手投票： 如果你的家里有一条切片面包， 谁会把那些面包皮―― 就是那第一片和最后一片面包片―― 哪些家庭会把这些吃掉？ 好的，大部分人，不是所有人，但是绝大多数人， 而这也是，我很高兴地说，全球都是这样， 但是有没有人看到超市或者三明治店里 世上任何地方卖的三明治 上面有面包皮？（笑声） 至少我没见过。 所以我继续想，这些面包皮都去了哪里？（笑声） 这就是答案，很不幸： 每天都有13,000块新鲜面包 从这一个工厂里产出，这是非常新鲜的、刚出炉的面包。 在我访问这个工厂的同一年， 我去了巴基斯坦，那儿2008年时还有很多人还在挨饿。 这是全球粮食供应紧张造成的。 是我们导致了供给紧张， 我们把食物丢进英国垃圾桶里 还有世界各处。我们把 那些饥饿的人赖以生存的食物从商店货架上拿了下来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:20	<br><br>
	
往上走一步，你就能找到农民， 他们把三分之一或者更多的 收成都丢掉，只因为外形标准。 举例说，这个农民投资了16,000英镑 来种菠菜，但是没有收割一片叶子， 因为菠菜之间长了一些草。 那些外形不完美的土豆 都归猪所有。 对超市来说太小的欧洲萝卜， 特内里费的西红柿， 佛罗里达的橙子， 厄瓜多尔的香蕉，那是我去年去过的地方， 都被丢弃了。这是厄瓜多尔的 一个香蕉种植园一天之内的废弃量。 全部被丢弃了，明明完全都能食用， 只因为它们的形状或者大小不对。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:01	<br><br>
	
如果我们对水果和蔬菜这样做， 我们肯定也会这样对待动物。 肝脏，肺脏，头部，尾部， 肾脏，睾丸， 所有这些被丢弃的脏器都是传统意义上 可口又营养的美食部分。 最近30年，内脏消费量在 英国和美国减少了一半。 结果是，这些东西最好的下场是喂狗吃了， 或者被焚烧。 这个男人，在中国西部的新疆省喀什市， 正在做他的民族佳肴。 它叫做羊内脏。 既美味又有营养， 还有我去喀什的时候学到， 它代表食物浪费的禁忌。 当我坐在路边的咖啡馆里， 一个厨师来跟我说话，我刚吃完了我碗里的饭， 而话谈到一半，他不说话了 然后开始对着我的碗皱眉头。 我想，“天啊，我打破了哪些禁忌？ 我如何侮辱了这个厨师？“ 他指着我碗底的三粒米， 然后说"吃干净。" (笑声） 我想，”天啊，你知道，我到世界各地 告诉大家停止浪费食物。 这个人居然在我的游戏里让我输得一败涂地。”(笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:06	<br><br>
	
但是这给了我信心。它给了我信心，我们人类 有力量来停止这种悲剧般的资源浪费 如果我们把大规模的食物浪费视作 不被社会接受的， 如果我们发出声音，告诉企业， 告诉政府我们不想再看到食物被浪费， 我们有能力来带来变化。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:26	<br><br>
	
鱼，40%到60%的欧洲的鱼 被丢弃在海里，他们甚至都没上过岸。 在我们的家里，我们已经失去了与食品的接触。 这是一个我在三棵生菜上做的实验。 谁把生菜放在冰箱里？ 大部分人。左边的 是在冰箱放了10天的。 中间的那棵，是放在我厨房桌上的。没什么区别。 右边的这棵我把它视为精心修剪的花。 它是一个有生命的机体，我把它一片一片切下来， 放在一个有水的花瓶里， 它在两周后都是好的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:57	<br><br>
	
有些食物浪费，像我在一开始说的那样， 是不可避免的，所以问题是， 最好的解决方法是什么？ 我15岁就回答了那个问题。 实际上，人类在6,000年前就回答了这个问题： 我们驯化了猪， 把食物残渣转换成食物。 然而，在欧洲，这种做法已成为非法行为 自从2001年口蹄疫爆发后。 这不科学，也毫无必要。 如果你做饭给猪，就像 你做饭给人类一样，就是安全的。 同时也能减少很多资源利用。 现在，欧洲依赖着从南美进口 几百万吨黄豆， 其生产导致全球气候变暖， 大片森林遭砍伐以及生物多样性的丧失， 来饲养在欧洲的牲畜。 同时我们扔掉几百万吨 可以饲养这些牲畜的食物。 如果我们那样做了，把它喂给猪，我们可以减少 那么多的二氧化碳。 如果我们浪费的食物， 这是现在政府最喜欢用的处理剩余的食物的方法， 进行厌氧消化，将食物渣滓 转换成汽油来生产电， 你能省下微不足道的448公斤的二氧化碳 在每吨食物残渣里。把这些食物残渣喂给猪更好。 在战争时期我们就懂得。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:15	<br><br>
	
有一线希望：它在全球已经拉开序幕， 就是寻求解决粮食的浪费的方法。 Feeding the 5000是一个我在2009年第一次组织的活动。 我们用本会被丢弃的食物 喂饱了5000个人。 从那以后，在伦敦又进行过一次， 全国各地以及国际上也在进行着。 这是所有组织在一起 赞美食物，并同意处理食物的最好方法 就是吃它和享受它，而不要去浪费。 为了我们所赖以生存在的地球， 为了我们的孩子， 为了其它 跟我们一起分享地球的生物， 我们是陆生动物，而我们依赖我们的土地 来给我们供应食物。此刻，我们正在摧毁我们的土地 来栽种没有人吃的食物。 停止浪费食物。非常感谢。（鼓掌声） （鼓掌声） 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">The voices of China's workers</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of workers ― the millions of people who migrate to factories in China and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world. Reporter Leslie T. Chang sought out women who work in one of China's booming megacities, and tells their stories. 	<br><br>

Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day: our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones. Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt. Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes, or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad. We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves. After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one? It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive, and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing, especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world, but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways. In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors: its low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands. By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets, we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone. 	<br><br>

Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world. In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. 	<br><br>

Here are a few. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker, so I'm not in a rush." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year, everyone said I had changed. They asked me, what did you do that you have changed so much? I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:48	<br><br>
	
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me. Just to make money is not enough meaning in life." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:58	<br><br>
	
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English, because in the future, our customers won't be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:14	<br><br>
	
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan. Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. Other subjects came up almost never, including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life: 10 or 15 workers in one room, 50 people sharing a single bathroom, days and nights ruled by the factory clock. Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances, and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. When I asked Lu Qingmin, the young woman I got to know best, what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like "qiu xi." Only much later did I realize that she had been saying "QC," or quality control. She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor. All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism, the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor. Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets, the worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work. But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong. Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that, a piece of something. What she does with the money she earns, what she learns in that place, and how it changes her, these are the things that matter. What a factory makes is never the point, and the workers could not care less who buys their products. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories, on the other hand, plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make. Many articles calculate: How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he's making? For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:46	<br><br>
	
But how meaningful is this calculation, really? For example, I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine, but I can't afford to buy an ad in it. But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker, and most of these workers don't really want iPhones. Their calculations are different. How long should I stay in this factory? How much money can I save? How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car, to get married, or to put my child through school? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor. About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year. On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim. I thanked her, assuming it was fake, like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan. After we got home, Min gave her mother another present: a pink Dooney & Bourke handbag, and a few nights later, her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag. Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory, and every single one of them was authentic. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
Min's sister said to her parents, "In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars." Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless. "And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line, 2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000." She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:42	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:46	<br><br>
	
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency. They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth. Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married, she brought a handbag along as a wedding present. Another time, after Min had already left the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit, bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:15	<br><br>
	
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic. In 1941, the burnished patina of an all-American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather. Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair. They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:53	<br><br>
	
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters. Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny than he could have imagined. And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses, to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:14	<br><br>
	
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory. Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs five times, eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory. Later, she married a fellow migrant worker, moved with him to his village, gave birth to two daughters, and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents. She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:56	<br><br>
	
In a recent email to me, she explained, "A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:10	<br><br>
	
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities. Together, they make up the largest migration in history, and it is globalization, this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think. Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers. I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them, or that they would have nothing to say to me. Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous. By opening up their lives to me, they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family. I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about, ties that are not economic but personal in nature, measured not in money but in memories. This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine, sitting in your office or in the library, are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:49	<br><br>
	
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:58	<br><br>
	
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before. But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say, with Apple's head of manufacturing, what would you say? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:12	<br><br>
	
Leslie Chang: One minute? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:13	<br><br>
	
CA: One minute. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:15	<br><br>
	
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful, and the thing that struck me, what they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds. They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade. Their parents are often illiterate, and then they come to the city, and they, on their own, at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class, they'll take an English class, and learn really, really rudimentary things, you know, like how to type a document in Word, or how to say really simple things in English. So, if you really want to help these workers, start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes in these schools, and what's going to happen is, all your workers are going to move on, but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple, and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement. When you talk to workers, that's what they want. They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers. I want a nicer room. I want a TV set." I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:14	<br><br>
	
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward. If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now basically urban middle class people, so the trajectory is definitely upward. It's just hard to see when you're suddenly sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and desperate, but that's not really how it is. Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:09	<br><br>
	
CA: Thanks so much for your talk. Thank you very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
嗨。今天我想来探讨一下 这些为我们制造日常用品的人们： 例如我们的鞋子，手提包，电脑，还有手机。 这个话题时常让我们觉得很内疚。 想象一下，一个年轻的农村女孩给你缝制跑步鞋 可每个小时还赚不到一美金， 又或者是那个加班为你组装iPad的中国小伙子 在加班之后从楼上跳了下来。 我们，是全球化的受益者， 可每笔交易却似乎都是在剥削那些受害者， 而这种不公平 似乎也深深烙印在这些产品之中。 总而言之，这个世界到底怎么了？ 一个在组装iphone生产线上的员工却买不起一台iphone？ 人们理所当然地认为，中国的工厂就是应该被压榨的， 因为我们渴求便宜的产品 造成了这样的局面。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:03	<br><br>
	
很显然，西方社会的需求 和中国人对他们遭遇的申诉被连接在一起， 尤其是当我们中的很多人已经因为我们对世界影响 而感到了内疚， 然而，这是不正确的，也是不尊重他人的。 我们极其自恋地去想象着 我们有力量去操控地球另一边 千万的人民，让他们以如此可怕的方式 去遭受痛苦或者迁移。 事实上，中国制造的产品遍布全球， 也包括他们自己的市场，这要归结于许多因素的综合： 低成本，大量受过教育的劳动力， 还有有弹性的工作制度 这些都快速地迎合了市场的需求。 我们因为太专注于我们自身和产品上， 所以忽视了产业链另一端的个体的存在 将他们看成是可以随时被替换的，微小的 像手机零件那样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:57	<br><br>
	
中国工人并不是因为我们对于iPods的无限渴求 而被迫进入工厂的。 他们选择离乡背井，是为了赚钱， 为了学习新的技能，以及为了看看这个世界。 在对全球化发展趋势的辩论中 我们缺失的，是聆听工人们自己的声音。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:15	<br><br>
	
以下就是一些例子。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
包永秀（音译）说：“我妈妈让我回家结婚 但是如果我还没有让自己得到充分的发展 就结婚，我只能嫁给一个平凡的工人， 所以我根本不着急。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
陈颖（音译）说：“我过年回家的时候 每个人都说我变了，他们问我： 你怎么会有这么大的改变？ 我告诉他们，我很努力地学习和工作， 即便你想给他们讲更多，他们反正也不能理解。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:48	<br><br>
	
吴春明（音译）： “即使我赚了很多钱 也无法满足我自己。 赚钱并不是生活全部的意义。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:58	<br><br>
	
肖金（音译）说： “现在我下班以后，就会去学英语 因为在不久的将来，我们的客户将不仅仅是中国人， 所以，我们需要学习更多的语言。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:08	<br><br>
	
以上的话，都是出自一些年轻女孩的口， 她们仅仅18、19岁。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:14	<br><br>
	
因此，我花了两年时间去了解流水工作线上的工人们 例如在中国南部的一个工业城市――东莞。 有一些主要的问题不断的重复着： 他们到底赚了多少钱， 她们想要嫁给怎样的人， 他们是否想要跳槽 还是留在一个工厂内。 另一些话题，则几乎不被提起 例如：在我眼中如牢狱般的生活条件 10-15个工人住在一个房间里， 50个人公用一个厕所， 日以继夜地按照工厂的要求来作息。 他们每一个人都知道，即便是住在如此的环境里面 也会比他们在中国农村的老家的条件 好得多 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
工人们很少谈论他们制造的产品， 他们往往很难解释清楚 他们到底做了什么。 我访问了吕清民（音译） 这个年轻的女孩是我最了解的， 我问她她在工厂里到底从事什么工作 她用中文告诉我，听起来像是 “秋西。” 很久以后，我才知道她说的是 "QC"，也就是质量监控。 她竟然都不能告诉我她在工厂里做的是什么。 她能做的就只是模仿一个英文缩写的发音 而这个语言是她根本就不懂的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
马克思认为这就是资本主义的悲哀 疏远了工人与他们所制造的产品。 与传统的鞋匠或者木匠不同， 工人在工厂没有控制权， 在她所做的工作中，没有快乐， 没有真正的满足或理解。 但同许多马克思 坐在英国图书馆的阅读室里想出来理论一样， 这一点，他错了。 仅仅因为一个人用她的时间 去制造一件物品，并不代表 她就变成了这件物品。 她用她赚的钱去做了什么 她在那个地方学到了什么技能，以及她如何被改变 这些才是重要的。 一个工厂制造什么并非重点， 工人们也不在乎谁买了他们制造的产品。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
记者报道了关于中国工厂的新闻 另一方面，也强调了 工人与产品之间的联系。 很多文章都在计算： 这些工人要工作多久，赚来的钱 才够买一件他们制作的产品？ 举个例子，一个初级组装生产线的工人 在中国组装iPhone配件 要倾其2个半月的工资才能买一台iPhone。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:46	<br><br>
	
但说真的，这些计算有任何意义吗？ 再举个例子，我最近写了一篇文章 登在纽约客杂志上， 但是也供不起我在杂志上登一个广告。 但是，谁在乎？我不需要在纽约客上登广告 其实，大部分的工人，也不是真的需要iPhone。 他们的计算方式是不同的。 我在工厂要待多久？ 我能存多少钱？ 我需要多少钱才能买个房子，买辆车， 才能结婚，或者足以送我的小孩去学校？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:15	<br><br>
	
这些我试图去了解的工人们 对他们和产品之间的联系有着很抽象的解读。 大概在我遇到陆青敏，也就是小敏的一年后 她邀请我去她农村的家做客 过春节。 在回家的火车上，她给了我一个礼物： 一个棕色皮质的Coach牌零钱包。 我谢了她，虽然我很自然地认为这应该是个山寨的产品， 就好像东莞在出售的大部分产品一样。 回家以后，小敏给了她妈妈另一个礼物： 一个Dooney &amp; Bourke牌的粉色手提包， 几天以后，她的姐姐正在展示 一个红褐色的LeSportsac单肩包。 慢慢地，我好想明白了 这些东西都是她们工厂生产的 每一件东西，都是正品 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:02	<br><br>
	
小敏的姐姐告诉她父母 “在美国，这个包要卖320美金。” 她的农民父母看了看，无言以对。 还有，Coach正在推出一系列新产品2191 她说：“这个好像要卖6000。” 她停顿了一下：“我不知道是6000人民币，还是 6000美元，无论如何都是6000啦。” （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
小敏姐姐的男友也回到家 与她一起过年， 他说：“看起来不值这么多钱。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
小敏的姐姐对他说：“有的人 就是懂这些东西，你懂啥。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:42	<br><br>
	
（笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:46	<br><br>
	
在小敏的世界里，Coach包包有一个很奇怪的价值。 它们虽然不是一文不值，但是相比起它们的实际价值 还是相差甚远，因为她们所结识的人里面 几乎没有人想要买，也没有人知道这值多少钱。 有一次，小敏大姐的一个朋友结婚 她带着一个手提包作为给新人的礼物。 又一次，小敏已经离开手提包的工厂了 但她的小妹妹来看她的时候 带了两个经典款Coach作为礼物。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:15	<br><br>
	
我打开一个有拉链的口袋 看到一张卡片写着一些英文： “美国经典。 1941年那些表皮磨光的 美国棒球手套 启发了Coach的创始人 促使其研发了一个新系列的手提包： 奢华、柔软的的表面和手套的皮质一样。 6名技巧纯熟的皮革工人制造12只经典款手提包 他们有着精准而快速的手艺。 这些手提包新颖，具有相当的功能性，世界各地的女人都喜欢 一个新的美国经典诞生了。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:53	<br><br>
	
我想知道马克思是否会被小敏 和她的姐妹所影响。 她们与产品之间的关系 更复杂、惊奇而且有趣 这都超出他的想象。 但是，他对这个世界的观点没变，而我们却将 这些工人们看成是一群上不了台面的群体， 想象一下，假如我们可以了解工人们的真实想法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:14	<br><br>
	
我第一次见到小敏的时候，她刚满18岁 她刚刚辞去在一家电子设备工厂的 组装生产线的工作。 接下来的两年，我看着她换了5次工作， 最后固定在一个比较赚钱的职位 是在一个硬件工厂的采购部门。 不久，她嫁给了一个打工仔， 然后移居到了他的村子， 生了两个女儿， 他们存够了钱给她买了一辆二手别克车 给她的父母买了房子。 最近她独自回到东莞 在一个起重机工厂里找了份工作， 暂时与她村里的丈夫和孩子 分居两地。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:56	<br><br>
	
在最近的一封邮件里，她解释： “人们年轻的时候，应该有所抱负 那么在他们老的时候，回首过去 就不会觉得这一生都毫无意义。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:10	<br><br>
	
在中国，有1亿5千万像她一样的工人， 其中三分之一，是离乡背井的女性， 她们在工厂、酒店、餐厅 或者是大城市的建筑工地工作。 这么算来，是她们创造了历史上一个庞大的人口迁移的数字， 而这个产业链的起点，就是“全球化”的风靡 从中国的农村 到最终进入我们口袋里的iPhone和脚上的耐克 还有手中的Coach手提包 这改变了数百万人的 工作、婚姻、生活和思想。 他们其中很少有人 愿意回到过去的生活。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
我第一次去东莞的时候，我很担心 担心与工人相处的时间会很压抑沮丧。 我也担心他们永远不会改变， 或者他们也没有什么能对我说的。 然而，我发现那些年轻的女性都很聪明、风趣 而且勇敢、大方。 通过向我展示她们的生活， 她们教给我很多关于工厂 关于中国，以及如何生存在这个世界的道理。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:20	<br><br>
	
这就是小敏在回家的火车上 送给我的Coach钱包。 我一直保存着它，由此提醒着我与这些 我记录过的年轻女生的联系， 这些并不是因为经济而是因为个人情感的联系， 价值并不是在于金钱而是记忆。 这个钱包也是一个提醒， 你坐在办公室或图书馆里时所想象的东西 和你走出去真正接触的东西 并不一样。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:49	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:58	<br><br>
	
谢谢，Leslie，真的很有见地 我们中很多人从未这么思考过。 但是我很好奇，如果你有一分钟时间 对Apple制造商的领导人说一些话 你会说什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:12	<br><br>
	
一分钟？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:13	<br><br>
	
是的，一分钟。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:15	<br><br>
	
你们知道吗，那些工人们真正启发我的 是他们的自我激励、自我推进 还有足智多谋，都深深警醒着我 他们最想要的是教育，是学习 只是因为他们大部分有着穷困的家庭背景。 他们通常中学就离开学校了。 他们的父母大都是文盲， 他们独自来到城市打拼 晚上或者周末，他们去学习电脑的课程， 或者是学英语， 就是学一些真的非常非常基本的东西，你知道吗？ 例如如何在Word里面打字 或者用英语讲一些简单的事情。 所以，如果你们想要帮助那些工人 开展一些小型、集中、基础的课程 这会带来的结果就是 你的工人得到了提升， 但是希望，他们也会晋升到Apple更高的职位中 你可以帮助他们适应社会流动性 帮助他们得到自我的提升。 当你于工人们交谈，你就会知道这就是他们所要的。 他们不会说：我想要浴室里有更热的水 我想要一间更好的房间，想要一个电视 我的意思是，有这些东西固然很好 但是他们来到这个城市不是为了这些， 而且他们根本不在乎。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:14	<br><br>
	
他们有没有说过 生活环境真的很艰苦，或者是 自我得到提升以后，这些东西 也会得到相应改善？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
当然，当然了。我是说，大家都知道 这其实很有趣，我花了大概2年时间 在东莞生活 在这个时间里面，你可以看到每个人的生活 都在起着巨大的变化：变得更好，变坏，或者偏离轨道 但总体来说，都是在进步的。 只要你花足够的时间，就会变好 如果一个人十年前来到城市 现在应该已经成为城市的中层阶级， 所以总体趋势一定是变好的。 只不过你初入城市的时候 一下子还无法感知。看起来好像每个人都很穷 很失落，但这都不是真实的。 可以肯定，工厂的环境十分艰苦 在坐的你我都不会愿意前往， 但是比起他们所来自的地方，站在工人的角度来看 这都是值得的，他们也希望 所去的地方这些都会得到改善，我只想 把他们所想的东西陈述出来 而这些并不等同于你们所认定的东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:09	<br><br>
	
感谢你的演讲。 非常感谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>

So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years, which made me nostalgic, because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid, maybe 12 years old. And I wondered if I could update that game, not just for modern methods, but for the modern me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:35	<br><br>
	
So I tried. I went to an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth." You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth. And the first rule of the game is pretty simple. You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know, and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
And in this case, I quickly found this: The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought, it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun, so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle, like some Earthlings. And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes, it's one degree away from the equator, it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:23	<br><br>
	
And it is really fun to say. So I immediately decided, this is going to be the name of the game, or my new exclamation. You can use it at TED. Chimborazo, right? It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby. I didn't know that; that's pretty cool. Chimborazo! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple. You just have to find another term and look that up. Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically, maybe getting sidetracked, that was fun. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from. I can go literally anywhere in the world, I think since I was already in Ecuador, I just decided to click on the word "tropical." That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:07	<br><br>
	
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south, that much I knew, but I was surprised to learn this little fact: Those are not cartographers' lines, like latitude or the borders between nations, they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt, and they change. They move; they go up, they go down. In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about 15 meters per year, and nobody told me that. I didn't know it. Chimborazo! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:38	<br><br>
	
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up. Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest." Famous for its diversity, human diversity. There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests. This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera, which turn out to be beetles. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
Now I clicked on this on purpose, but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake, it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles," for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle," but I am here for beetle beetles. This is the most successful order on the planet by far. Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet, including plants, are beetles. That means the next time you are in the grocery store, take a look at the four people ahead of you in line. Statistically, one of you is a beetle. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:53	<br><br>
	
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted. There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums. There are predator beetles, that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us. There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings. This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri, who renews the ball of the sun every morning, which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom. Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles. Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
Like my next link: The chemical language of pheromones. Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex. Yeah. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
And the link to aphrodisiac. Now that's something that increases sexual desire, possibly chocolate. There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac. But as the article mentions, because of enzyme breakdown, it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally. So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:23	<br><br>
	
The link I clicked on here, "sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean. But not when they're together like that. I do like sympathy. I do like magic. So when I click on "sympathetic magic," I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:43	<br><br>
	
This is the boy in me getting lucky again. Sympathetic magic is imitation. If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it. That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:54	<br><br>
	
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind. I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves. We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork. Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands, usually the left hand. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia, so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube, I can easily picture how he did it. And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand," go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this: The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now, every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand," I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that, I just don't know it's freaking name, right?" And the link I clicked on here, well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:07	<br><br>
	
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative. Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller." He doesn't. He lives in rainforests and savannas. It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us, evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us, and in some cases, he gets places before us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp. I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact. He's born in Cameroon, which is smack in the middle of my tropics map, and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:49	<br><br>
	
In between those two landmarks in Ham's life, he flew into space. He experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:03	<br><br>
	
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page, I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature, huge in heroism. Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters, that is less than five and a half feet tall max, possibly because he was malnourished as a child. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
Germans occupied Russia. A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household, and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut. Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space, the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet. And he didn't just leave it, he circled it once. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:49	<br><br>
	
Fifty years later, as a tribute, the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight, synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit, at the exact same time of day, and filmed it, so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride, possibly a lonely one, the first person to ever see such a thing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:12	<br><br>
	
And then when you've had your fill of that, you can click on one more link. You can come back to Earth. You return to where you started. You can finish your game. You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:25	<br><br>
	
And for me, I quickly landed on this one: The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid, which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy. I found it myself. It's got some math that I can do. I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it. What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball, if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls, fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea, you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball, it would be as smooth as a billiard ball, presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:18	<br><br>
	
That's pretty cool. I didn't know that. Chimborazo! 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:25	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:26	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
上个月，大英百科全书宣布， 在墨印了244年后， 它即将停止继续印刷。 这让我变得很怀旧， 因为我想起了一个我小时候在我家乡的 图书馆中用一本巨大的百科全书所玩的游戏， 那时我大概12岁左右吧。 而我想我是否可以将那个游戏升级， 不仅用现代化了的方式， 也是为了今天的我。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:35	<br><br>
	
所以我尝试了。 我上了一个在线百科全书， 维基百科，然后输入了“地球”。 你可以从任何地方开始，这次我选了地球。 游戏的第一个规则很简单。 你只需要阅读这篇文章， 直到你找到一个你不知道的东西， 最好是连你父亲都不知道的东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:52	<br><br>
	
而这次，我很快的找到了这个： 离地球中心最远的点 并不是珠穆朗玛峰的顶端，像我想的那样， 而是这个山脉的顶端： 厄瓜多尔的钦博拉索山。 地球会自转，同时也在绕着太阳公转， 所以地球的中线部分有些突出， 像一些的地球人一样。 而虽然钦博拉索山不是安第斯山脉最高的山峰， 它离赤道只有一个度的差距， 它就在那突出的上方，所以钦博拉索山的巅峰 是地球上离地球中心最远的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:23	<br><br>
	
它的名字读起来也很有意思。 所以我立刻就决定了， 它将是我的游戏的名字， 或者我新的惊叹词。 你也可以在TED这里使用。 钦博拉索，是吧？ 它就像“尤里卡（找到了）”和“宾果（中了）”的孩子。 这我之前不知道， 而它也挺有意思的。 钦博拉索！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
而游戏的下一个规则同样简单。 你只需要找到下一个词汇，然后搜索它。 在以前，这意味着拿出一本书 然后按字母顺序搜索。 中间你可能会被其他的吸引， 而它很好玩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:51	<br><br>
	
现在你有上百个链接可以选择。 我可以去世界上的任何地方， 我想，既然我已经在了厄瓜多尔， 我决定选择“热带”这个词汇。 它将我带到了围绕着地球的一个潮湿并 温暖的热带雨林中。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:07	<br><br>
	
那是北面的北回归线 以及南面的南回归线， 这些是我知道的。 但我很惊讶的学到了这一小个事实： 这些不是制图者的线， 像纬度或国家的边界， 它们代表着地球倾斜造成的天文现象， 而它们一直在改变。 它们会动；有时上，有时下。 事实上，在很长的时间中，北回归线和南回归线 在稳定的以每年15米的速度 朝着赤道移动。 而没人告诉过我这点。 我之前并不知道。 钦博拉索！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:38	<br><br>
	
为了让游戏继续，我只需要再找一个词来搜索。 既然我已经在热带区域了，我选择了“热带雨林”。 它因为它的人类的多样化而闻名。 在这个星球上仍然有着很多没有接触过的人类部落， 他们散步在全球各地，但基本上所有都住在热带雨林中。 这是地球上唯一一个你不会被在脸书上加为好友的地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
我点的这个链接在开头时很奇异，而在后面变的越来越神秘。 它提到了豹子和环尾长鼻浣熊和毒箭娃和蟒蛇以及 甲虫类， 也就是甲虫。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
我是有意的点了这个的， 但假如我因为某种原因搞错了， 它会提醒我，如果找到的乐队，看“甲壳虫乐队”， 找的是车，那看“大众甲壳虫”， 但我是来看真的甲虫的。 它是地球上最成功的物种。 地球上所有的生命中，包括植物在内，有 百分之二十到二十五都是甲壳虫。 这意味着，下一次你在杂货店的时候， 看看你队伍前方的四个人。 统计上来说，你们其中有一个是甲壳虫。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:53	<br><br>
	
而如果这是你，你适应得非常好。 有在博物馆吃骨头上的皮肤和肉的拾荒者甲壳虫。 有攻击其他昆虫但 任然看起来很可爱的捕食者甲壳虫。 有甲壳虫将粪便滚成小球 并将它滚过沙漠上很长的距离来喂养它的后代。 这让古代的埃及人想起了它们的神赫普里， 他在每天早上都重新点燃太阳的火球。 这就是为什么滚粪便的圣甲虫 变成了图坦卡蒙法老胸甲上的圣甲虫。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
甲壳虫们，提醒了我，它们有着动物界中最浪漫的调情手段。 萤火虫不是像苍蝇，萤火虫是甲虫。 萤火虫是甲虫类的，而甲虫类也会用很多其他的方法来交流。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
就像我下一个连接： 信息素的化学语言。 这信息素的网页带我到了一个海胆交配的视频。 嗯。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:58	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:01	<br><br>
	
以及一个催情剂的链接。 它提高性欲， 像巧克力。 巧克力中有一种东西叫苯乙胺， 它很有可能是一种催情剂。 但这篇文章说， 因为酶的作用， 如果口服的话，苯乙胺很有可能不会到达你的大脑。 所以在座的只吃你们的巧克力的，你可能需要尝试一下。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:23	<br><br>
	
在这里点的链接叫 "感应巫术"，因为我明白这两个词的意思， 但不明白它们的组合。 我喜欢同情，我也喜欢魔术。 所以当我点了“感应魔术”时， 我看到了感应魔术和巫毒娃娃。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:43	<br><br>
	
我的童心又被挑起了。 感应魔术的基础是模仿。 如果你模仿一样事物，或许你也可以影响到它。 这是巫毒娃娃的原理，也有可能关联到石洞壁画。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:54	<br><br>
	
石洞壁画的链接带我到了一些人类最古老的艺术。 我很想看用谷歌地图看看这些洞穴的内部。 我们有万年之前的艺术品。 全球的一些共同主题包括巨型动物以及人类手掌的轮廓描绘， 通常是左手。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
我们从千年前便是主右手的部落， 所以虽然我不知道为什么一个旧石器时代的人会描画他的手， 又或往它上面（从管子中）吹出色素， 我可以很容易的想象出他是怎么做到的。 而我也不觉得它和在我们这里用的手型光标有什么区别 我将用它点击“手”这个词汇的链接。 在“手”的页面上，我找到了在很长时间内都是最好玩但也让我羞愧的 一个细节。它很简单： 手的背面正式的被叫做 Opisthenar （手背）。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
这有些尴尬，因为知道现在， 每次当我说，“我熟悉它就像我熟悉我的手背一样“， 我其实都在说，”我非常的熟悉它， 我只是不知道它的名字（那个复杂的单词）而已？” 我点击的这个链接， 说狐猴，猴子和黑猩猩都有小的手背。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:07	<br><br>
	
我点了黑猩猩，然后我被带到了和我们的基因最近的亲戚。 Pan troglodytes （黑猩猩）这个给它的名字，意思是“穴居者”。 他其实不住在穴内。 他住在雨林和大草原上。 只是我们总是觉得它被我们甩在身后， 奇怪的在进化的过程中尾随着我们， 而在某些情况下，他在我们的之前到达一些地方。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:28	<br><br>
	
像我的下一个链接，一个几乎无法抗拒的链接，太空猩猩汉姆。 我点击了他，以为他会带我两次回到游戏的原点。 他在喀麦隆出生， 喀麦隆就在我的热带地图的中央， 而更特别的，它的骨骼在史密斯森协会博物馆中被甲虫清理的很干净。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:49	<br><br>
	
在这两件汉姆的里程碑中， 他飞入了外太空。 他比第一个人类太空员， 苏联宇航员尤里・加加林，早几个月 经历失重并重返地球。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:03	<br><br>
	
当我点击了尤里・加加林的网页， 我看到了这个身材让人惊讶的短小，但 异常英雄的一个人物。 最高的估计，苏联的估计，说他有1米65， 而这最多只有5个半英尺高， 有可能因为当他是孩子的时候他有过营养不良。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:20	<br><br>
	
当时德国人侵入了俄罗斯。 一个纳粹军官抢了加加林家的房子， 然后他和他的家人造了一个泥房居住。 很多年后，那个拥挤的泥房中的小男孩 会长成为那个在火箭顶端的 拥挤的航天仓中的， 自告奋勇的被发射出外太空的男人， 我们之中第一个来真正地离开这个星球。 而他不仅仅离开了它。 他围绕着它转了一圈。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:49	<br><br>
	
五十年后，为了向他致敬， 至今还在上面的国际太空站 将它的轨道与加加林的轨道在一天中 同样的时间时重叠， 并拍了下来。 你可以上网看这个大概100多分钟的 迷人的旅行， 一个孤独的旅行， 作为第一个看到它的人类。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:12	<br><br>
	
当你看完了它后， 你可以再点击一个连接， 并回到地球。 你回到你开始的地方。 你可以完成你的游戏。 你只需要在找一个你不知道事实。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:25	<br><br>
	
对我来说，我很快的看到了它： 地球离参考椭球有着大概百分之0.17的公差， 比桌球的百分之0.22标准更小。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:37	<br><br>
	
我小的时候非常喜欢这种事情。 我自己找到了它。 它有着一些我可以做的数学。 我很确定我爸爸也不知道。 这个的意思是，你可以将地球缩小到一个桌球的大小， 如果你可以将地球，以及它上面的高山和洞穴 和雨林，航空员和未接触部落和黑猩猩，巫毒娃娃们， 萤火虫，巧克力，在海洋内交配的海生物们， 你将它缩小的一个桌球的大小， 它会想桌球一样的光滑， 大概就像一个中间稍微有些突出的桌球。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:18	<br><br>
	
这很有意思。 我以前也不知道。 钦博拉索！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:25	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:26	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>

As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion. And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century. It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors, but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater. So let the story begin. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:45	<br><br>
	
On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856. Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born. His name was Nikola, Nikola Tesla. Now the baby grew into a very smart guy. Let me show you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:15	<br><br>
	
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:20	<br><br>
	
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way. When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. Tree. Chair. Girl. They were hallucinations, which vanished the moment he touched them. Probably a form of synesthesia. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
But it was something he later turned to his advantage. Where other scientists would play in their laboratory, Tesla created his inventions in his mind. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
MT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it. Only then do I construct it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:25	<br><br>
	
MT: His great idea was alternating current. But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe? To sell his idea, he became a showman. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:40	<br><br>
	
NT: We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity. I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether. It is the magic of science. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:02	<br><br>
	
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body. But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
But Tesla's success didn't last. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
NT: I had bigger ideas. Illuminating the city was only the beginning. A world telegraphy center -- imagine news, messages, sounds, images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:08	<br><br>
	
MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project. Expensive, too. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:12	<br><br>
	
NT: They wouldn't give me the money. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:22	<br><br>
	
MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. Dodged by death, he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. 	<br><br>

身为魔术师，错觉艺术一直是我的最爱。 在二十世纪初期极受欢迎的Tanagra大剧院 就是错觉艺术的典范。 剧院使用了一组镜子 来制造小矮人在微缩舞台上表演的假象。 不过今天我不会使用镜子， 而是用数码设备向Tangara剧院致敬。 故事开始了： 	<br><br>

那是1856年七月十日， 一个风雨交加...真是狂风暴雨啊...的夜晚。 一道闪电击穿了乌云， 一个小男孩出生了。 小男孩叫做特斯拉（Nikola Tesla，著名电磁学家） 小男孩叫做特斯拉（Nikola Tesla，著名电磁学家） 小男孩长大后成为了一个聪明的人。 我让你们见识一下。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:08	<br><br>
	
“特斯拉，236乘501等于几？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:15	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“等于118236” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:20	<br><br>
	
特斯拉的思维非常神奇。 每当人们说到一个词， 特斯拉的脑子里 立刻就会出现一个画面。 “树”，“椅子”，“女孩”。 这些画面只是幻觉。这要他用手一碰， 它们就会消失。 这也许是一种特殊的感知力， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
不过长大后的特斯拉 已经能够很好的运用它了。 当其他科学家还在实验室里埋头用工时， 特斯拉在自己的脑海里进行创造。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“太好了，我发现我可以用最棒的方式“看见”我的发明！” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
当这些创意在特斯拉脑海里遨游之后， 他便在工作室里把这些发明制造出来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:11	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“我不需要模型，不需要草图，不需要实验。” 特斯拉：“我在脑子里就能构想它们的模样，” 特斯拉：“启动，调试，改进它们。” 特斯拉：“然后我才会动作制作。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:25	<br><br>
	
他的伟大发明 是交流电。 可他如何说服大家， 这项发明能够安全地在百万伏特的电压下运行？ 为了推销他的发明， 他成为了表演家。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:40	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“我们正在一个新时代的黎明，” 特斯拉：“一个电的时代。” 特斯拉：“通过精密的设计，” 特斯拉：“我只需要轻轻触动开关” 特斯拉：“就能将电力传遍世界。” 特斯拉：“这是科学的魔力！” （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:02	<br><br>
	
特斯拉拥有700多项专利发明： 广播，无线电报， 远程遥控，机器， 他甚至拍摄过人体骨骼。 但是对他最重要的还是实现儿时的梦想： 利用尼加拉瀑布的巨大能量 来照亮城市。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
但他的成功没能持续下去。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“我有更大的梦想。” 特斯拉：“照亮城市只是第一步。” 特斯拉：“我要造一个世界电报中心。想象一下：” 特斯拉：“新闻，讯息，声音，图像，” 特斯拉：“能无线地瞬间传遍” 特斯拉：“世界每一个角落。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:08	<br><br>
	
这是个伟大的计划。庞大而昂贵的工程。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:12	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“他们不会资助我的。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
好吧，也许你不该告诉他们这东西能用来联络外星人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“哎，失误。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:22	<br><br>
	
特斯拉的发明家生涯再也没有好转过。 他成为了隐士。 躲避死亡 大部分时间他都住在 位于Waldorg-Astoria的小房子里。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:35	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“我做的每件事都是为了全人类。” 特斯拉：“都是为了穷人们不再被富人欺负，” 特斯拉：“为了智慧，科学与艺术的产物” 特斯拉：“能过造福社会，美化我们的生活。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
尼古拉・特斯拉逝世于1943年一月七日。 他最终长眠于 位于贝尔格莱德(塞尔维亚首都)的特斯拉博物馆 里的一座金色球形棺材里。 但他带给人们的财富流传至今， 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:15	<br><br>
	
特斯拉照亮了世界， 而这只是一个开始。 特斯拉的思想意义深远。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
特斯拉：“告诉我，当森林被伐尽，煤矿被采光时，” 特斯拉：“我们该怎么办？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:34	<br><br>
	
特斯拉曾经觉得他有办法。 直到今天我们依然在问相同的问题。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">The mathematics of history </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
What can mathematics say about history? According to TED Fellow Jean-Baptiste Michel, quite a lot. From changes to language to the deadliness of wars, he shows how digitized history is just starting to reveal deep underlying patterns. 	<br><br>
Jean-Baptiste Michel	<br><br>
	
 May 2012	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language. It has generated considerable insight in physics, in biology and economics, but not that much in the humanities and in history. I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind, that you cannot measure history. But I don't think that's right. I want to show you a couple of examples why. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:32	<br><br>
	
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact: that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language. That's a powerful historical force. So the king of England, Alfred the Great, will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z. (Laughter) Now it's just the way it is. Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that. So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation. So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past. "Today I walk. Yesterday I walked." But some verbs are irregular. "Yesterday I thought." Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular. Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:18	<br><br>
	
So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of English language, and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change, namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another, it regularizes 10 times slower. That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
Now in some cases math can even help explain, or propose explanations for, historical forces. So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries. There's actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller. So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I. So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that? What's the origin of this? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:12	<br><br>
	
So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis, propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this, which lies in our brains. This is a very well-known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways -- quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot. It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously. But it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously. So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000. And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:17	<br><br>
	
So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them, but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace. The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace. So there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million actually. And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:09	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>

数学是一门很有用的语言。 在解释物理、生物以及经济学方面， 它拥有与生俱来的洞察力， 但对于历史等人文学科解释力稍弱。 我想有人认为用数学解释人文学科是不可能的， 因为你不能量化人类的行为， 你也不能用数学来度量历史。 但我并不这样认为， 我想向大家展示几个反例。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:32	<br><br>
	
我和我的合作伙伴Erez考虑了以下事实： 这个事实就是身处不同时代的君王 会用非常不同的语言交谈。 这是一股非常强大的历史作用力。 因此英国国王阿尔弗雷德大帝， 将会使用一种语法和词汇， 而这种语法和词汇是完全不同于hip hop之王Jay-Z所使用的。 （笑声） 这就是我想说的事实。 语言与时俱进，并且拥有强大的力量。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
因此我和Erez想了解更多有关语言的历史。 我们研究了一个特定的语法规则：过去式。 人们通过在动词后面加“ed”来表示过去。 例如：“Today I walk.”今天我走路， “Yesterday I walked.”昨天我走路。 但有一些动词的变形是不规则的。 例如：“Yesterday I thought.”昨天我思考了。 这里有趣的现象是： 从阿尔弗雷德大帝到Jay-Z时代，不规则动词变的越来越规则了。 例如你们这里看到的动词“to wed”就变成了规则动词。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:18	<br><br>
	
因此我和Erez跟踪了100个不规则动词 在12个世纪的英语演化中的命运， 我们发现了一个非常简单的数学规律 来捕捉复杂的历史变化， 这个规律就是，如果一个动词比另一个动词的使用频率高一百倍， 这个动词规则化的速度就会慢十倍。 这是历史的一部分，但却以数学的方式得以展现。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
在某些情况下，数学甚至可以帮助解释， 或者对历史的推动力加以解释。 我和Steve Pinker 考虑了过去两个世纪中战争的激烈程度。 事实上有一条广为人知的规律： 造成一百倍伤亡人数的战争数目 只占更少伤亡人数的战争数目的十分之一。 有30场战争的伤亡人数与“六日战争”（第三次阿以战争）的几乎持平， 但只有4场战争比“六日战争”的伤亡人数高出一百倍， 例如第一次世界大战。 那么这背后的历史原因是什么呢？ 什么是这条规律的原因呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:12	<br><br>
	
我和Steve通过数学分析， 认为这是由一个非常简单的现象导致的， 而这个现象植根于我们的意识之中。 这是一个众所周知的特征， 人们对数量的感觉是相对的， 诸如光源的强弱或者声音的大小。 下面有个例子，派遣10000名士兵去参加下一场战斗乍一听是很多人。 特别是如果你之前只派遣了1000名士兵去参战的话，这个数字就更显得庞大了。 但同样的数字也会显得不那么多， 当它还不足以造成巨大的差别的时候， 假如你之前已经派遣了100000名士兵参加战斗。 因此你们会看到由于我们对数字的感觉是相对的， 随着战争的延续， 参战士兵的数量及伤亡人数 将不会线性地增加， 例如从10000到11000再到12000， 而是呈指数增加的――起先是10000，之后是20000，再后来就成了40000。 而这正好解释了我们之前看到的规律。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
这里数学能够将有关个体认知的常识 和长期的历史规律联系起来。 这种历史规律可以延续数个世纪并在各个大洲有效。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:17	<br><br>
	
今天我们只有有限的几个诸如此类的例子， 但我认为在未来的十年间它们（用数学解释历史规律）会越来越多。 而其原因则是历史记录 正以非常快的速度被数字化存储。 自人类的文明史发端至今 我们大约拥有了1.3亿本不同的书。 而像谷歌这样的公司正致力于将其中很多书数字化存储 事实上被数字化的数量已经超过了2千万本。 而当历史记录能以数字格式被存取的时候， 回顾人类历史文化规律 的相关数学分析 会变得快捷而且方便。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
因此我认为在接下来的十年， 自然科学和人文科学会更加紧密 并能够解释有关人类的深层次问题。 我认为数学将会成为进行这项工作的有力工具。 数学会帮助我们发现人类历史中的新规律， 有时也许可以解释某些规律， 甚至在未来我们可以利用数学来预测将要发生的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:09	<br><br>
	
非常感谢大家。 	<br><br>

As we expect more from technology, do we expect less from each other? Sherry Turkle studies how our devices and online personas are redefining human connection and communication ― and asks us to think deeply about the new kinds of connection we want to have. 	<br><br>

Just a moment ago, my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck. Her text said, "Mom, you will rock." I love this. Getting that text was like getting a hug. And so there you have it. I embody the central paradox. I'm a woman who loves getting texts who's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:44	<br><br>
	
Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story. 1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk, Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row. I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine. In those heady days, we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities. We were exploring different aspects of ourselves. And then we unplugged. I was excited. And, as a psychologist, what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves, about our identity, to live better lives in the real world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:38	<br><br>
	
Now fast-forward to 2012. I'm back here on the TED stage again. My daughter's 20. She's a college student. She sleeps with her cellphone, so do I. And I've just written a new book, but this time it's not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine. So what happened? I'm still excited by technology, but I believe, and I'm here to make the case, that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
Over the past 15 years, I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people, young and old, about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are. Some of the things we do now with our devices are things that, only a few years ago, we would have found odd or disturbing, but they've quickly come to seem familiar, just how we do things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
So just to take some quick examples: People text or do email during corporate board meetings. They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes, during presentations, actually during all meetings. People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you're texting. (Laughter) People explain to me that it's hard, but that it can be done. Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents' full attention. But then these same children deny each other their full attention. This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together. And we even text at funerals. I study this. We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
Why does this matter? It matters to me because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble -- trouble certainly in how we relate to each other, but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection. We're getting used to a new way of being alone together. People want to be with each other, but also elsewhere -- connected to all the different places they want to be. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention. So you want to go to that board meeting, but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. And some people think that's a good thing. But you can end up hiding from each other, even as we're all constantly connected to each other. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:04	<br><br>
	
A 50-year-old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work. When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody, he doesn't call. And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues because, he says, "They're too busy on their email." But then he stops himself and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth. I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted. I think I should want to, but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
Across the generations, I see that people can't get enough of each other, if and only if they can have each other at a distance, in amounts they can control. I call it the Goldilocks effect: not too close, not too far, just right. But what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships. An 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully, "Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I'd like to learn how to have a conversation." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
When I ask people "What's wrong with having a conversation?" People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation. It takes place in real time and you can't control what you're going to say." So that's the bottom line. Texting, email, posting, all of these things let us present the self as we want to be. We get to edit, and that means we get to delete, and that means we get to retouch, the face, the voice, the flesh, the body -- not too little, not too much, just right. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:05	<br><br>
	
Human relationships are rich and they're messy and they're demanding. And we clean them up with technology. And when we do, one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection. We short-change ourselves. And over time, we seem to forget this, or we seem to stop caring. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question, a profound question. He said, "Don't all those little tweets, don't all those little sips of online communication, add up to one big gulp of real conversation?" My answer was no, they don't add up. Connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information, they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you," or even for saying, "I love you," -- I mean, look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter -- but they don't really work for learning about each other, for really coming to know and understand each other. And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves. So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection. For kids growing up, that skill is the bedrock of development. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
Over and over I hear, "I would rather text than talk." And what I'm seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation, so used to getting by with less, that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether. So for example, many people share with me this wish, that some day a more advanced version of Siri, the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone, will be more like a best friend, someone who will listen when others won't. I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I've learned in the past 15 years. That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology. That's why it's so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed -- so many automatic listeners. And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
We're developing robots, they call them sociable robots, that are specifically designed to be companions -- to the elderly, to our children, to us. Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other? During my research I worked in nursing homes, and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood. And one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal. It seemed to be looking in her eyes. It seemed to be following the conversation. It comforted her. And many people found this amazing. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:56	<br><br>
	
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life. That robot put on a great show. And we're vulnerable. People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing. So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy, I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize. It doesn't face death. It doesn't know life." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:33	<br><br>
	
And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion, I didn't find it amazing; I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments in my 15 years of work. But when I stepped back, I felt myself at the cold, hard center of a perfect storm. We expect more from technology and less from each other. And I ask myself, "Why have things come to this?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:07	<br><br>
	
And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:41	<br><br>
	
These days, those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies. One, that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; two, that we will always be heard; and three, that we will never have to be alone. And that third idea, that we will never have to be alone, is central to changing our psyches. Because the moment that people are alone, even for a few seconds, they become anxious, they panic, they fidget, they reach for a device. Just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light. Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved. And so people try to solve it by connecting. But here, connection is more like a symptom than a cure. It expresses, but it doesn't solve, an underlying problem. But more than a symptom, constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves. It's shaping a new way of being. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:47	<br><br>
	
The best way to describe it is, I share therefore I am. We use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we're having them. So before it was: I have a feeling, I want to make a call. Now it's: I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. The problem with this new regime of "I share therefore I am" is that, if we don't have connection, we don't feel like ourselves. We almost don't feel ourselves. So what do we do? We connect more and more. But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:29	<br><br>
	
How do you get from connection to isolation? You end up isolated if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude, the ability to be separate, to gather yourself. Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments. When we don't have the capacity for solitude, we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive. When this happens, we're not able to appreciate who they are. It's as though we're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self. We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone. But we're at risk, because actually it's the opposite that's true. If we're not able to be alone, we're going to be more lonely. And if we don't teach our children to be alone, they're only going to know how to be lonely. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
When I spoke at TED in 1996, reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities, I said, "Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection." And that's what I'm calling for here, now: reflection and, more than that, a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us, what it might be costing us. We're smitten with technology. And we're afraid, like young lovers, that too much talking might spoil the romance. But it's time to talk. We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. But it's not, it's early days. There's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it, how we build it. I'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices, just that we develop a more self-aware relationship with them, with each other and with ourselves. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:38	<br><br>
	
I see some first steps. Start thinking of solitude as a good thing. Make room for it. Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children. Create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen, the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation. Do the same thing at work. At work, we're so busy communicating that we often don't have time to think, we don't have time to talk, about the things that really matter. Change that. Most important, we all really need to listen to each other, including to the boring bits. Because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:29	<br><br>
	
Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other, how we care for ourselves -- but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. I'm optimistic. We have everything we need to start. We have each other. And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:07	<br><br>
	
So in my work, I hear that life is hard, relationships are filled with risk. And then there's technology -- simpler, hopeful, optimistic, ever-young. It's like calling in the cavalry. An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars, you can "Finally, love your friends love your body, love your life, online and with avatars." We're drawn to virtual romance, to computer games that seem like worlds, to the idea that robots, robots, will someday be our true companions. We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:55	<br><br>
	
But our fantasies of substitution have cost us. Now we all need to focus on the many, many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives, our own bodies, our own communities, our own politics, our own planet. They need us. Let's talk about how we can use digital technology, the technology of our dreams, to make this life the life we can love. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:30	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

几分钟之前 我的女儿 Rebecca 发了一条短信为我加油。 她说 “妈妈，你会震撼全场的！” 我太喜欢这个了 接到这条短信 就像得到了她的拥抱。 所以大家看到了 我自己 就处在这样一个核心矛盾里。 我自己 非常喜欢收短信 但却要告诉大家 太多的短信会成为一个大问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:44	<br><br>
	
事实上，我的女儿 让我想起了这个故事的开端。 1996年我第一次在 TED 演讲的时候 Rebecca 只有5岁 她就坐在那里 最前排。 那时我刚刚写了一本书 庆祝我们的网络新生活 而且将要成为《连线》杂志 (Wired) 的封面人物。 在那些令人陶醉的日子里 我们体验着 网络聊天室和在线虚拟社区。 我们正从不同的角度探索自己。 然后我们回到现实中来。 我对此感到非常兴奋。 作为一个心理学家，最令我兴奋的 就是这样的理念： 我们会运用我们在虚拟世界中 对自己，对我们自身认同的了解 改善我们的现实生活。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:38	<br><br>
	
现在让我们快进到2012年 我又重新回到了 TED 的讲台。 我的女儿已经是一名20岁的大学生了。 她睡觉都抱着她的手机。 其实我也是。 我刚刚完成了一本新书， 但是这一本却不会 让我登上《连线》杂志 的封面。 那这十几年间发生了什么呢？ 我仍然为科技而兴奋 但是我相信 并且想要向大家说明 我们正在放任科技 它将我们带向歧途。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
在过去的15年间 我一直在研究移动通信技术的影响 并且访问了成百上千的人， 年轻的或年长的 了解他们的“移动生活”。 我发现 我们口袋中 那些轻巧的电子设备 在心理学上有着如此强大的力量 它们不仅改变了我们的生活方式 也改变了我们本身。 我们现在用电子设备做的一些事情 在几年前 还被认为是稀奇 或让人讨厌， 但是很快大家就习以为常 ――只是我们的行事方式而已。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
让我们来举几个简单的例子。 人们在公司的董事会议上 发短信或写邮件， 人们发短信，网购，浏览脸谱―― 上课时，听报告时， 实际上在几乎所有的会议时。 甚至有人告诉我一项重要的新技能―― 发短信时如何与别人 进行眼神交流！ （笑） 他们说这虽然难 但还是可以做到的。 父母们在早餐和晚餐时 发短信和邮件 孩子们因此抱怨 父母对他们不够关注。 但是同时这些孩子 也很少专心地与彼此相处。 这是一张我女儿和她朋友们 最近的照片， 她们虽然处在同样的空间 确没有真正地一起相处。 人们甚至在葬礼上发短信。 我研究这一现象： 我们需要别的东西 来分散我们的悲伤或者胡思乱想 所以我们需要玩手机。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:04	<br><br>
	
这样有什么问题吗？ 我认为这的确是个问题： 我们正在为自己挖陷阱， 这个陷阱无疑会影响 人与人之间的联系， 同时也会影响 我们和自己的联系， 降低我们认识和反省自己的能力。 我们越来越习惯这种新的 "一起独处” 的相处方式。 人们希望待在一起， 但是同时也 “在别处”―― 连线到他们想去的不同地方。 人们想要定制他们的生活， 想要在不同的场合和地点之间切换， 因为对他们来说最重要的是 控制和分配他们的精力。 例如你想去参加董事会议 但是只想关注你感兴趣 的一小部分内容。 有人认为这是好事 但是长此以往， 人们就会对别人隐藏自己， 即便我们一直保持着彼此间的联系。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:04	<br><br>
	
一位50岁的商人 曾悲哀地告诉我 他觉得工作时不再有同事了。 他工作时不会停下来和别人说活。 他不打电话 他说他不想打断他的同事， 因为，他说：“ 他们都在忙着发邮件。” 但是然后他停下来， 他说：“ 其实我没有说实话，” “ 我也不想让别人打扰我。” “ 我觉得我应该想（被打扰）的，” “ 但是实际上我更愿意用我的黑莓手机（联系别人）。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:35	<br><br>
	
不管哪一代人， 我发现他们没法从彼此那里得到足够的关注―― 如果他们仅仅 将彼此保持在一种 可以控制的距离范围里。 我把这种现象称作 Goldilocks 适宜效应： 不太近，也不太远， 刚刚好。 但是对于刚才那位中年商人来说 刚刚好的距离 对需要学会与人面对面交流的 青少年来说，却可能太过疏远。 有一个18岁的孩子 他几乎任何事情都用发短信解决， 他惆怅地跟我说 “总有一天， 但是当然不是现在 我会学习一下如何跟人交谈。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
我问人们 “为什么不面对面交谈？” 他们回答说：“ 因为面对面交谈 是实时发生的， 你没法控制你要说什么。” 所以这才是最重要的： 发短信， 写邮件，贴照片发状态 所有这些 都能让我们向别人呈现出我们想变成的样子。 我们可以编辑 就是说我们可以删除， 可以修改和润色 我们的面容，声音 甚至我们的整个形象 让它不少也不多 刚刚好。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:05	<br><br>
	
人类的关系非常丰富 也很复杂， 而且需要技巧和精力来处理。 我们现在可以用技术使它变简便。 在我们做这种简化时 一个很可能的问题就是 我们为了简便的联系 放弃了面对面的交流。 我们这是自欺欺人。 长此以往 我们似乎忘记了这一点 或者没有人在乎这一点了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:32	<br><br>
	
Stephen Colbert问过这样一个 让我猝不及防的 深刻的问题。 非常深刻。 他说：“ 难道那些 微小的简短的 在线交流的片段 加在一起不能等同于 真正的交谈吗？” 我的回答是“不能”。 那些片段不能整合在一起。 以这种小片段的方式交流 可能可以收集到那些精心修饰过的信息， 可能表达 “ 我在想你 ”， 甚至表达 “我爱你”， 的确， 想象一下 接到女儿那条短信时我有多么高兴。 但是那些小片段 很难让我们互相了解， 真正地了解和理解对方。 我们在与彼此交谈的同时 也学习着如何 同自己交流。 所以放弃面对面交谈 确实有着很大的影响， 因为这会损害 我们自我反省的能力。 对于孩子们来说 这项能力是成长的一个重要的基石。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
我一次又一次地听到： “比起说话我更愿意发短信。” 我所看到的也是 人们如此习惯于自欺欺人， 逃离真实的交谈， 如此习惯于逃向更少更浅的交流， 以至于他们几乎越来越希望 躲开别人。 比如说， 很多人跟我讲过这样的愿望， 有一天，更高版本的Siri， （苹果公司iphone的智能语音助手） 会更像一个好朋友， 一个当别人都无暇顾及你时 还耐心聆听的挚友。 我相信这样的愿望 反映了过去15年间 我了解到的一个痛苦的事实： 那种 “没有人愿意听我倾诉” 的感觉 在我们与科技的关系里 起了重要的作用。 这是解释了为什么我们这么喜欢 脸谱页面 或者推特页面。 上面有这么多自动生成的听众呀！ 而且那种没人倾听的感觉 使我们更愿意和 看似关心我们的机器待在一起。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:03	<br><br>
	
我们在开发一种 被称作“社会性机器人” 的产品， 它们是专门设计来 陪伴老人， 孩子， 甚至我们每个人的。 我们已经对给予彼此关怀 毫无信心了吗？（要转而依赖机器人？） 我的有一项在 疗养院进行的研究， 我们把 “社会性机器人” 带到疗养院里 希望它们可以给予老人 被理解的温暖感。 一天，我走进疗养院 看到一位失去孩子的妇女 正在对着 一个小海豹形状的机器人说话。 这个机器人看上去像在看她的眼睛， 看上去像听得懂她说话， 它可以给她安慰， 很多人都觉得这种技术很棒。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:56	<br><br>
	
但是那位妇女居然在试图让 一个对人类的生活轨迹 毫无感受的机器理解她！ 那个机器人只是完成了一场很棒的表演。 我们是如此脆弱， 会把伪装的同情和共鸣 当作真的。 在那位妇女沉溺于 机器人带给她的 伪装的同情的时候， 我在想：“ 那个机器人不可能真正地同情。” 它不用面对死亡， 它也根本不懂人生。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:33	<br><br>
	
看到这位从机器人的陪伴 中寻找安慰的妇女， 我一点都不觉得这技术先进， 我发现那是我这15年的工作里 最复杂，最纠结，最不是滋味的时刻。 但是当我退一步来看， 我感到自己就在 这场完美风暴 冰冷无情的中心。 我们对于技术的期望越来越多 对彼此的期望却越来越少。 我问自己： “为什么会这样呢？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:07	<br><br>
	
我相信，原因是技术 最吸引我们的地方 正是我们最脆弱的一方面。 我们都很脆弱―― 我们很孤独 却又害怕亲密的关系。 所以我们研发社交网站和 “社会性机器人” 这样的技术 使我们可以在不需要真正友情的情况下 体验被关心和陪伴的幻觉。 我们借助技术找到和别人保持联系的感觉 并且可以舒服地控制这种联系。 但是其实我们并没有这么舒服， 也没能很好地控制。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:41	<br><br>
	
如今，我们口袋中的手机 正在改变我们的想法和我们的心灵， 缘于它们带来了三种 让人兴奋的错觉 一，我们可以把精力分配到 任何我们想关注的地方； 二， 总会有人倾听我们； 三，我们永远都不用独自一人。 这第三种 “我们永远不用独处” 的错觉 对于改变我们的心理状态是最关键的。 因为当人们独处的时候， 即使只有几秒钟， 他们也会变得焦虑，恐慌，坐立难安， 因而转向那些电子设备。 想想在人们在排队的时候， 等红灯的时候。 独处像是变成了一个亟待解决的问题。 所以人们试着用联系别人的方法解决它。 但是这种联系 更像是一种症状而不是真正的治疗。 它表达着我们的焦虑， 却没有解决根本的问题。 但是它又不仅仅是一种症状―― 频繁的联系改变着人们 对自己的理解。 它催生了一种的新的生活方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:47	<br><br>
	
对此最好描述是， “我分享，故我在。” 我们用技术来定义自己， ――分享我们的想法和感觉， 甚至在我们刚刚产生这些想法的时候。 所以以前，情况是 我有了一个想法， 我想打电话告诉别人。 现在，事情变成了，我想要有个想法， 所以我需要发短信告诉别人。 这种 “我分享，故我在” 的问题在于 如果我们跟别人断了联系， 我们就感觉不再是自己了。 我们几乎感觉不到自己的存在了。 所以我们怎么办呢？ 我们的联系越来越多。 但是与此同时 我们也把自己隔绝起来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:29	<br><br>
	
为什么联系会导致隔绝呢？ 原因是 没有培养独处的能力―― 一种可以与外界分离， 集中自己的思想的能力。 在独处中，你可以找到自己 这样你才能很好的转向别人， 与他们形成真正的联系。 当我们缺乏独处能力的时候， 我们联系别人仅仅是为了减少焦虑感 或者为了感觉到自己还活着。 这时候， 我们并不真正地欣赏别人， 而这好像是把他们当作 支撑我们脆弱的自我感的 备用零件。 我们简单地认为总和别人保持联系 就能让我们不那么孤单。 但是这是有风险的， 因为事实恰好相反。 如果我们不能够独处， 我们会更加孤单。 而如果我们不能教会我们的孩子独处， 他们只能学会 如何体验孤独。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
1996年我在 TED 演讲， 报告我关于 早期虚拟社区的研究时曾说： “那些对于网络世界 最为投入的人 是带着一种自我反省的精神上网的。” 这也是我现在想要呼吁的 我们需要一些反思，更甚者是，展开对话 讨论我们目前对技术的应用 会将我们带向何方， 会让我们失去什么。 我们被技术（带来的错觉）迷住了， 而且我们就像年轻的恋人一样 害怕说太多话会毁掉浪漫的气氛。 但是是时候该交谈了。 数字技术伴随我们长大， 所以我们也认为技术已经很成熟。 实则不然，它还在起步阶段。 我们还有很多的时间 来反思我们应当如何应用它， 如何发展它。 我并不是说 我们应该抛弃我们的电子设备， 我只是建议我们应当与电子设备， 与别人，也与自己， 建立更加有自我意识的关系。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:38	<br><br>
	
我们可以从这些方面开始改变： 把独处 当做一件好事， 为它留出空间。 向你的孩子们说明 独处的价值。 在家里开辟出专门的空间， 例如厨房或者客厅， 用于和家人交谈。 在工作中也可以这样。 我们在工作时总是忙于（浅层的）联系， 以至于没有时间思考， 也没有时间谈论 那些真正重要的事情。 是时候改变了。 最重要的是，我们真的需要聆听彼此， 包括说的那些无聊的细节。 因为正是在我们结巴，迟疑， 找不到合适的词的时候， 我们才向对方展现出真实的自我。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:29	<br><br>
	
技术正在试图 重新定义人们的联系―― 例如我们怎样关心别人， 和关心自己―― 但是它也给了我们机会来 确认我们的价值观 和发展方向。 对此我很乐观。 我们拥有做这种改变所需的一切。 我们身边有彼此， 而且我们有很大的几率成功， 只要我们意识到我们的脆弱性 ――我们会轻信 技术能 “将复杂的事情变简单” 的这种脆弱性。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:07	<br><br>
	
在我的工作中， 我常常听到 “生活很难”， “人际关系充满风险” 云云。 然后技术出现了， 更简单，充满希望， 乐观而充满朝气。 就像天降一位专家，解决所有烦恼。 一个系列广告这样说： 在线使用虚拟形象（avartar） 系统， 你 “最终就可以爱你的朋友， 爱你自己，爱你的生活， 如此简单。” 我们被虚拟的爱情吸引， 被电脑游戏营造的奇幻世界吸引， 也被 “机器人将会变成我们 最好的伴侣” 的想法所吸引。 我们晚上泡在社交网站上， 而不是和现实中的朋友去酒吧玩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:55	<br><br>
	
但是我们对于这些 网络替代品的幻想已经使我们失去了很多。 如今，我们需要专注于找到 可以让科技 将我们带回 现实生活的方法―― 带回到我们的身体，我们的圈子， 我们的社会，我们的政治， 我们自己的星球。 它们需要我们。 让我们来关注和讨论 如何运用数字技术， 那些我们梦想的神奇技术， 来帮助我们回归这样的生活， 充满爱的生活。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:30	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:32	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Yup, I built a nuclear fusion reactor</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Taylor Wilson believes nuclear fusion is a solution to our future energy needs, and that kids can change the world. And he knows something about both of those: When he was 14, he built a working fusion reactor in his parents' garage. Now 17, he takes the TED stage at short notice to tell (the short version of) his story. 	<br><br>
Taylor Wilson	<br><br>
	
   Mar 2012 	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
So my name is Taylor Wilson. I am 17 years old and I am a nuclear physicist, which may be a little hard to believe, but I am. And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point, that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to. So nuclear fusion is our energy future. And the second point, making the case that kids can really change the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:38	<br><br>
	
So you may ask -- (Applause) You may ask me, well how do you know what our energy future is? Well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old. That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor. I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old. I decided I wanted to make a star. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:02	<br><br>
	
Now most of you are probably saying, well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion. I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy. Well it doesn't break even. It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in, but it still does some pretty cool stuff. And I assembled this in my garage, and it now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada, Reno. And it slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it. So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun. And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together, and in the process it has some byproducts, and I utilize those byproducts. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:43	<br><br>
	
So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. For hundreds of dollars, I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars. I built this in my garage. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:06	<br><br>
	
And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes. Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities I've developed a device that, on a very small scale, can produce these isotopes. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there. That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor. Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage, so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians. So maybe I don't want to admit to that. This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world. And this is me with President Obama, showing him my Homeland Security research. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:52	<br><br>
	
So in about seven years of doing nuclear research, I started out with a dream to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage, and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world, and I think other kids can too. So thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:09	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
我叫泰勒 威尔逊， 今年17岁， 我是一名核物理学家， 可能你们很难相信，但我确实是。 我想说 核聚变 就是那个 布恩 皮肯斯（他的TED演讲里）谈到 能引领我们前进的桥。 核聚变就是未来的能源。 第二点就是 孩子能改变世界。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:38	<br><br>
	
你可能会问 （掌声） 你可能会问我， 你怎么知道未来的能源是什么？ 我14岁的时候造了一个核聚变反应堆， 我14岁的时候造了一个核聚变反应堆， 这是里面的构造。 我开始这项工程时， 那是我12，13岁的时候。 我决定我要造个星星出来。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:02	<br><br>
	
你们可能会说， 现在没有实用的核聚变 我没看到过有核发电站采用核聚变。 确实是这样。 它并没有产生多于我放进去的能量， 但是确实产生了一些有趣的事情。 我在我的车库里组装起来， 现在它在内华达大学雷诺分校 的物理系。 结合起来我们就得到了氘, 氘其实就是氢和多余的一个中子在里面 因此这个跟在太阳里面的质子链 那个反应很像 而且我在很用力地把他们结合在一起 当氢原子结合在一起的时候 会有一些附属品产生 而我就利用了这些附属品 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:43	<br><br>
	
因此上一年 我赢下了国际科学以及工程大会活动的第一名 我创造一个取代目前国家安全局 使用的探测器 花了几千美金 我创建了一个比花了几十万美金还敏感的 的探测器 我在我的车库建造出来的这个东西 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:04	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:06	<br><br>
	
而且我创建了一个系统 去生产医用的同位素 与其要求上百万美金的设备 我自己在很小规模上创建一个 可以生产这些同位素的设备 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:17	<br><br>
	
你们现在在这个背景上看到就是我们核聚变发生器 我在这个发生器的 控制板旁边 对了,我在我的车库做黄色蛋糕呢 因此我们核系统跟伊朗人一样先进 因此我不太想承认 这是我在CERN,是在瑞士的日内瓦 CERN是世界上最杰出的量子物理实验室 这是我和总统奥巴马 给他展现我的国土安全的研究 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
(鼓掌) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:52	<br><br>
	
因此呢在这做核试验 的十年时间 我有了一个梦想 我想创建一个“在瓶子中的星星”,一个在我车库里的星星 因此我最后和总统见面了 然后创建一些可以改变世界的东西 而且我希望其他人也可以这样做 非常感谢 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:09	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Comedy is translation</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Every act of communication is, in some way, an act of translation. Onstage at TEDxRainier, writer Chris Bliss thinks hard about the way that great comedy can translate deep truths for a mass audience. 	<br><br>
Chris Bliss	<br><br>
	
  Feb 2012	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers, for his storytelling, but even more, I think, for the beauty and precision of his prose. And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude" or the fantastical stream of consciousness in "Autumn of the Patriarch," where the words rush by, page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal South American jungle, reading Márquez is a visceral experience. Which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when I realized that I was being swept along on this remarkable, vivid journey in translation. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
Now I was a comparative literature major in college, which is like an English major, only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months, we got to read great literature in translation from around the world. And as great as these books were, you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect. But not so with Márquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own, which is an astonishing compliment. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it. It's called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward, "If This Be Treason." And it's a charming read. It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art. But the reason that I mention it is that early on, Rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight: "Every act of communication is an act of translation." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time, but for me, as often as I'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis, I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light. Ever since I can remember thinking consciously about such things, communication has been my central passion. Even as a child, I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else. So no ego problems. It's funny, my wife, Daisy, whose family is littered with schizophrenics -- and I mean littered with them -- once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God. I don't need a husband who wants to be." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:35	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:37	<br><br>
	
Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was, it was that second part, being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge I was gaining, where the futility of my quest really set in. Time after time, whenever I set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient, it had the opposite effect. Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is, "Hey, listen up, because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you," it's amazing how quickly you'll discover both ice and the firing squad. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:16	<br><br>
	
Finally, after about 10 years of alienating friends and strangers alike, I finally got it, a new personal truth all my own, that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that I was gaining, I'd better find a different way of going about it. And that's when I discovered comedy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:37	<br><br>
	
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language. If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies. And I'm not talking about all comedy here, because, clearly, there's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel. What I want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher's stone. It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world. Because that's what I take from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation. That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual, but leads to real change. Which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self-interest. Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that. It's part of our survival package, and that's why it's become so important for us, and that's why we're always listening at that level. And also because that's where, in terms of our own self-interest, we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond, our responsibility to the rest of the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:02	<br><br>
	
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire, I mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity. Now if you think back on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, they were devastating. Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness, cementing an impression that the majority of the American public still holds today. And the key detail of this is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the SNL writers. They were lifted verbatim from Palin's own remarks. (Laughter) Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word. Now that's honesty and integrity, and it's also why Fey's performances left such a lasting impression. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:56	<br><br>
	
On the other side of the political spectrum, the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl I knew that he'd made a direct hit. Now it's not often that I'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh, but it's really hard to argue with that punchline. The description perfectly captured Edwards' personal vanity. And guess what? That ended up being the exact personality trait that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:29	<br><br>
	
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart is by far the most -- (Applause) (Laughter) it's by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy. Survey after survey, from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy, has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:00	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:03	<br><br>
	
Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers, the larger point remains that Stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform. It's not. His intent is to be funny. It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true. And the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media. Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:50	<br><br>
	
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick, where you think it's going over here and then all of a sudden you're transported over here. And there's this mental delight that's followed by the physical response of laughter, which, not coincidentally, releases endorphins in the brain. And just like that, you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. This is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic, all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate. Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin, which throws our walls up sky-high. And the comedy comes along, dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest -- race, religion, politics, sexuality -- only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin, we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows, revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
Now let me give you an example from my act. I have some material about the so-called radical gay agenda, which starts off by asking, how radical is the gay agenda? Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most are to join the military, get married and start a family. (Laughter) Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life. (Laughter) Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:18	<br><br>
	
And that's followed by these lines about gay adoption: What is the problem with gay adoption? Why is this remotely controversial? If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay, you should be allowed to put it up for adoption. (Laughter) You have given birth to an abomination. Remove it from your household. Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination" and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby, this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter, to question its validity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
Misdirection isn't the only trick that comedy has up its sleeve. Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy. There are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline. Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?" (Laughter) That's an entire childhood in three words. (Laughter) Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:44	<br><br>
	
And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it's inherently viral. People can't wait to pass along that new great joke. And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world. Comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the Internet, social media, even cable TV. Back in 1980 when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident, I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that. And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts -- something about the Ignited Negro College Fund. Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue. And my guess here -- and I have no research on this -- is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it, you'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession. First there were drums and then knock-knock jokes. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:44	<br><br>
	
But it's when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that's crafted from honesty and integrity, it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation. Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett, who's the editorial cartoonist for the Lexington Herald-Leader. And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy. I was visiting with Joel the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened in December of 2009. And Joel was explaining to me that, because USA Today was one of America's four papers of record, it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference, which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on Monday, the opening day of the conference, it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision-makers. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:35	<br><br>
	
So we started talking about climate change. And it turned out that Joel and I were both bothered by the same thing, which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn't, which, to both of us, seems somewhat intentionally off point. Because first of all, there's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists. Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of Texas were on fire. And Perry's policy solution was to ask the people of Texas to pray for rain. Personally, I was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:37	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:42	<br><br>
	
But back in 2009, the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science. So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this. Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?" (Laughter) You've got to love that idea. (Applause) How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing? Not for God, not for country, not for profit -- just as a basic metric for global decision-making. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:35	<br><br>
	
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye. Shortly after the conference was over, Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on. And not long after that, he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year. And it didn't stop there. To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups, in the United States, Canada and Europe. And earlier this year, he got a request from the Green Party in Australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the Australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world. (Applause) That is a lot of punch for 14 words. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny, because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:46	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:48	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>

加布里尔 加西亚 马尔克斯（Gabriel García Márquez）是我最喜欢的作家之一 我喜欢他的叙事 更喜欢他的 描写的优美和精确 不管是《百年孤独》的开篇 还是《族长没落》中的 魔幻意识流 文字汹涌而过 一页又一页不间断的意象 在读者的脑海中流过 就像是 在南美洲的原始森林中蜿蜒流过的一条野性的河流 阅读马尔克斯的小说是一种特别震撼的 感人肺腑的体验 在阅读小说的体验中 让我认识到自己正藉由翻译 来经历一次十分特殊又生动的 旅程 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
在大学时我的专业是比较文学 这个专业与英文专业比较像 只不过我们不用花上三个月的时间研究乔叟 而是可以阅读全世界优秀文学作品的 翻译版本 这些书固然出色 但你也总是可以感觉到 翻译能够接近于原版完全的效果 不过马尔克斯的书可不一样 马尔克斯本人曾称赞英译本 超越了他的原作 这可是惊人的褒扬 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:17	<br><br>
	
所以，在知道这位译者Gregory Rabassa 自己写了一本关于翻译的书时 我迫不及待地去读了 这本书的书名来源于意大利的一句谚语 他在前言里提到 意思是“如果这是背叛” 真是一次令人愉悦的阅读体验 我要极力推荐给 任何对翻译艺术感兴趣的人 不过我提及这本书的原因是 Rabassa早前曾提出过 这样优雅简洁的见解 “每一次沟通的行为 都是一次翻译的行为” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
也许你们一直以来认为这是显而易见的 但是对于我来说 尽管每天都会遭遇 沟通上的困难 我也从没有看清沟通的这种内在挑战 （这句话）真是醍醐灌顶 从我记忆中 能够有意识地思考开始 我就对沟通这一课题倾注了主要的激情 记得在孩提时代 我就知道自己人生中真正想做的事 就是去理解所有的事物 然后去告诉所有的人 这可不是狂妄自大 有趣的是，我妻子Daisy 她的娘家到处都是精神分裂症患者 我是说到处都是 曾经跟我说过：“Chris，我已经有了一个自认为是上帝的兄弟” 我不需要一个想成为上帝的丈夫 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:35	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:37	<br><br>
	
后来，在我二十多岁的时候 我渐渐明白了 我那童年理想的前半部分是无法实现的 但是对于后半部分： 能偶成功地向他人传达 我自己获得的任何一种知识 无力感油然而生 一次又一次 每当我开始跟别人分享一些伟大的真理 对方本该感到感激的 但结果往往适得其反 有趣的是，只要你的开场白是 嘿，听好了 我要传授给你一些严肃的知识 之后，快的超乎想象，你就能（在对方眼里） 发现一种混合了冰冷和杀意的眼神 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:16	<br><br>
	
后来，在连续十年 无差别疏远朋友和陌生人之后 我终于悟到了 这是很个人化的一个真理 如果要跟别人很好地传达 自己的想法 我最好另辟蹊径 就在这时候，我发现了喜剧 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:37	<br><br>
	
喜剧的波段和其他种类的语言 截然不同 如果我把喜剧放在任意的一个光谱上 我想它的位置 介于诗歌和谎言之间 在这里我说的不是所有的喜剧 因为，明显的，有许多的幽默 安全地待在我们日常的所知所感范围内 我说的是 那些最棒的喜剧和讽刺 它们独具一种绕开人们正常视角的能力 就像点金石一样 它们运用我们传统智慧的普通金属 通过滑稽的手段 转换成一种不一样的看法 甚至是一种不一样的存在 因为这就是我 从这次大会的主题中得到的：翻译中的收获 沟通 不仅能使个人自身产生 更好的理解 还能带来真正的改变 根据我的经验 沟通能够对话和拓展 我们对于利己主义的概念 这会儿我自视甚高地谈论利己主义 因为我们天生利己 这是我们求生本能中的一项 这是它之所以对我们如此重要的原因 也解释了为什么我们只有在事关自身利益的时候才会去聆听 同时 只有当符合自身利益时 我们才会开始 努力去回应 我们对于他人的责任 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:02	<br><br>
	
我认为最好的喜剧和讽刺究竟是什么样的呢 首先，最重要的是 它们来源于真诚和正直 回想一下 Tina Fey在“周末夜现场”（ Saturday Night Live）节目中 对新获提名的副总统候选人 Sarah Palin 那真是杀伤力十足 Fey比任何一个政治权威人士都有效地表现了 这个候选人在严肃性上的缺失 大大加深了 大部分美国民众今天对于此事的印象 这个关键的细节就是 Fey的剧本不是由她所作 也并非出自栏目组的写手 而是原封不动地 来源于Palin自己的说辞 （笑声） 这是一个Palin的模仿者 逐字逐句地引用Palin自己说过的话 这就是真诚和正直 这也是Fey的表演 之所以能历久弥新的原因 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:56	<br><br>
	
还有一个政治领域的例子 当我第一次听到Rush Limbaugh 把总统候选人John Edwards比作布雷克广告女郎（Breck Girl）的时候 我就知道这段子会火 我不常把Limbaugh 和真诚正直联系在一起 不过这句如珠妙语可真是无可争议 这个描述完美地刻画了 Edwards的虚荣心 你猜怎么？ 事实证明，就是他的这种性格特征 成为了终结他政治生涯的那件丑闻的核心原因 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:29	<br><br>
	
“约翰 C斯图尔特每日秀”（The Daily Show with John Steward） 是迄今为止最…… （掌声） （笑声） 是迄今为止关于 此类喜剧的效力存档最为完整的例子 一个又一个的民意调查 从皮尤研究中心（ Pew Research）到安纳博格公共政策中心（Anneberg Center for Public Policy） 都发现“每日秀”的观众对于时事更了解 相比于网络和电视新闻的观众 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:00	<br><br>
	
（鼓掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:03	<br><br>
	
无论这个发现是说明了 公司新闻的真实性 和盈利性之间的冲突 还是说明了斯图尔特的观众的关注度 最重要的观点是 斯图尔特的创作素材 总是植根于真实事件 但他的目的不是告知，不是的。 他的目的是搞笑。 斯图尔特的搞笑招牌 只在素材是真实的条件下才发挥作用 结论是，优秀的喜剧 也是一种信息传播系统 它在可靠性和记忆方面的得分 远远超过专业新闻媒体 这真是双重讽刺 想想喜剧之所以 能够触及人心 靠的是有意误导 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:50	<br><br>
	
优秀的喜剧是语言的魔术 你以为它是往这儿走 但刹那间就出现在那儿 精神上的欢乐 引发了笑这种生理反应 并非巧合地 释放了脑内的内啡肽 这样，你就会被诱导着 从另一个角度看待问题 因为内啡肽能让人放下自我防卫 这种作用机制 与愤怒、恐惧和惊慌 这类“逃跑或战斗”反应的作用机制正好相反 “逃跑或战斗”释放肾上腺素 将自我防卫的高墙推到天那么高 而喜剧 涉及了许多 我们拥有最强自我防卫的领域 比如种族、宗教、政治、性 只有用幽默，而不是用肾上腺素 来接近这些领域，内啡肽 和笑的魔力才会把自我防卫的高墙变成窗口 展现出一个意料之外的全新视角 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:45	<br><br>
	
让我给你们一个我自己的例子 我手头上有一些 关于所谓“激进同性恋议程”的资料 开篇是问 “同性恋议程”到底有多激进？ 因为从我所了解到的，美国同性恋者最想做的三件事 就是入伍、结婚、和建立家庭 （笑声） 这三件事我这辈子都不想做 （笑声） 放手去做吧，你们这些激进的混蛋。场地归你了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:18	<br><br>
	
那份资料后面 提到了同性恋收养 同性恋收养有什么问题？ 为什么会有轻微争议？ 如果你认为你的宝宝是个同性恋者 你应该被允许去让别人收养他/她 （笑声） 你生了个让人憎恶的东西 它从你的家里赶出去 把圣经用词“可憎之物” 用到婴儿这种纯洁的终极化身上 这个笑话 让争论背后的情绪电线短路 留给听众一个机会，能够通过他们的笑声 去质疑这场争论的正确性 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:55	<br><br>
	
误导可不是喜剧的 袖中所藏的唯一伎俩 语言的节极致简约 是喜剧的另一件强有力的外衣 没有什么 比一个完美的笑点能集中 包含更多的题材和象征 Bill Hicks，如果你不知道这个人的作品 你真的应该去google他 Hicks表演中的一个惯例 是要提到他童年时代在操场上的吹牛比赛 有一个孩子冲他吼到 “我爸爸能揍扁你爸爸！” Hicks回答说 “真的？多快？” （笑声） 整个童年 都浓缩在这几个字当中了 （笑声） 更别提这句话透露出多少 关于那个对此侃侃而谈的成年人了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:44	<br><br>
	
最后，喜剧作为一种沟通方式 还有一个强大的属性 那就是它内在的扩散性 人们迫不及待地 传播新的好笑话 这在现代社会可不是什么新生现象 喜剧早就能以惊人的速度 跨越国境了 早在我们有互联网、社交媒体 甚至是有线电视之前 在1980年 喜剧演员Richard Pryor不小心烧到了自己 在一次活动中 我在事件发生的第二天在洛杉矶 两天后到达华盛顿特区 我在东西海岸听到的笑点一模一样 着火的黑人大学基金 明显的，它不是出自“今夜秀”（Tonight Show）的独白 我猜想――没有验证过―― 如果你真的回过头去做些研究 你会发现喜剧 是第二古老的传播性质的职业 最早是鼓乐 然后就是敲门笑话（谐音笑话）了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:42	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:44	<br><br>
	
当你把具备了所有的要素 你有了一个适合传播的好笑话 一个来自真诚和正直、 精心安排的有力笑点 就能够拥有 改变对谈的真正效用 我有一个好朋友，名叫Joel Pett 他是一名社论漫画家 为《列克星顿先驱领袖报》工作 他曾经为《今日美国》（USA TODAY）早报周一版工作 我和Joel一起去了哥本哈根 就在气候大会召开的一个星期前 2009年12月 Joel跟我解释说 因为《今日美国》 是全美发行量最高的四份报纸之一 基本上大会的每一个参加者都会读到 这就意味着，如果他能画出轰动的作品 在周一，也就是大会的第一天出版 就可能让大会最高层人士 也就是真正的决策者看到 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:35	<br><br>
	
于是我们开始讨论气候变化 结果Joel和我两人 都为同一件事烦恼 太多的争论 都集中在科学方面 技术够不够完善 我俩觉得 这是离题的 因为，首先，这里有一个错误的前提 是完美的科学是存在的 德克萨斯州长佩里（Perry） 在去年夏天说过一模一样的话 在他那注定失败的 共和党总统提名选举伊始 他就一遍遍地重申科学还不够完善 同时德州有250个县 ――德州统共有254个县―― 发生了火灾 佩里的对应政策是 让德州民众 祈求降雨 就我自己而言，我祈祷的内容是让剩下的那4个县也着火吧 这样那该死的科学就完善了 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:37	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:42	<br><br>
	
回到2009年 Joel和我反复思考的问题是 为什么事到如今 还要花那么多精力来讨论科学 而气候政策要解决的问题 无疑是人类长期的利益 其中无所谓科学 我们反复讨论，最终Joel画出了这幅作品 漫画：“假使这是一场大骗局，我们就会徒然创造一个更好的世界？” （笑声） 你会爱上这个创意 （鼓掌声） 我们何不努力让世界变好，而不为了什么？ 不为上帝，不为国家，不为利益 只是作为一种全球性决策的基本标准 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:35	<br><br>
	
这幅漫画直击要害 在大会结束不久后 Joel收到一个索取签名副本的请求 来自于华盛顿州环境保护局局长 而这幅画现在还挂墙上 又过了没多久，加州环保局也来 索取了一份拷贝 用于局长的演讲 在一次国际气候会议上 去年在萨克拉门托 还不止这些 至今为止，Joel收到了来自40多个环境组织的请求 来自美国、加拿大和欧洲 今年早些时候 澳大利亚绿党向他索要拷贝 用于他们的宣传活动 引发热烈的讨论 最终让澳大利亚国会 采取了新的碳排放税收制度 是全世界最苛刻的 （鼓掌声） 这14个单词 可真够强劲的 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
我对于你们这些 认真考虑地球未来的人有一个建议 那就是每天花上一点时间 练习一下用喜剧思维来思考 因为你很可能就此找到一直在追寻的问题所在 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:46	<br><br>
	
感谢各位 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:48	<br><br>

There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the 19th century. It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the 1930s. And the poem goes: "On the idle hill of summer, lazy with the flow of streams, hark I hear a distant drummer, drumming like a sound in dreams, far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by, dear to friend and food to powder, soldiers marching, soon to die." Those who are interested in poetry, the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:47	<br><br>
	
But what Housman understood, and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too, was that the long, hot, silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close, and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes. And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by turbulence, and all too often by blood. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:14	<br><br>
	
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned, if you like, to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world, the new powers that exist in the world, are beginning to take form. And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times, and all too often very bloody times. By the way, it happens about once every century. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:44	<br><br>
	
You might argue that the last time it happened -- and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations, the old powers of Europe, across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America -- the beginning of the American century. And of course, into the vacuum where the too-old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars. Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars, and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:19	<br><br>
	
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times. But for us, I want to talk about three factors today. And the first of these, the first two of these, is about a shift in power. And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to, which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now. But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world. And what is happening today is, in one sense, frightening because it's never happened before. We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different. For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. It's also moving vertically. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage. The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power. And where, at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law, on the international stage it is not. The international stage and the global stage where power now resides: the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters, the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers, if you like, the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently, the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries. These live in a global space which is largely unregulated, not subject to the rule of law, and in which people may act free of constraint. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment. It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint, but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later, unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted -- international trade, the Internet, etc. -- but also by the things you don't want -- international criminality, international terrorism. The revelation of 9/11 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth, nevertheless, those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning. It's said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11 actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which 9/11 destroyed. You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:20	<br><br>
	
Sooner or later, sooner or later, the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow. And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is, that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power, then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim: to bring governance to the global space. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
Now notice, I'm not talking about government. I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution. My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions. If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it. The world needs an international forum. It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action. But when it comes to governance of the global space, my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions. It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems, treaty-based agreements, to govern that global space. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:32	<br><br>
	
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge. The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization, entirely treaty-based, and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States, to account if necessary. Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization. The G20: we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation. And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:01	<br><br>
	
Now there's a problem there, and we'll come back to it in a minute, which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions, to fill that governance space, then what happens to the weak who are left out? And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:20	<br><br>
	
So there's my first message, that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently, then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space. And watch that beginning to happen. My second point is, and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing, but power is not just shifting vertically, it's also shifting horizontally. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:50	<br><br>
	
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations, has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean, the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic. Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking, away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard] to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim. Now that begins with economic power, but that's the way it always begins. You already begin to see the development of foreign policies, the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world. I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East; something different is happening. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:31	<br><br>
	
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed. We are coming out of 50 years, most unusual years, of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world, in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus. But that's not a usual case in history. In fact, what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history. You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:14	<br><br>
	
Up until now, the United States has been the dominant feature of our world. They will remain the most powerful nation, but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world. And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China, of course, though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth. It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy. But that's a subject of a different discussion. You see India, you see Brazil. You see increasingly that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans, much more like Europe in the 19th century. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:52	<br><br>
	
Europe in the 19th century: a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning, used to describe it as the "European concert of powers." There was a balance, a five-sided balance. Britain always played to the balance. If Paris got together with Berlin, Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance. Now notice, in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world, you have fixed alliances -- NATO, the Warsaw Pact. A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances. But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances. And that's the world we're coming into, in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed. Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said, "Britain has a common interest, but no common allies." And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out, have to reach out, beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
Note, that when we went into Libya, it was not good enough for the West to do it alone; we had to bring others in. We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in. My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves, and we haven't succeeded. My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power, Western institutions and Western values. You know, up until now, if the West got its act together, it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world. But that's no longer true. Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War. The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved. Now we have to call in others. Now we have to create the G20. Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:48	<br><br>
	
Let me make a prediction for you, which is probably even more startling. I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough. People say to me, "The Chinese, of course, they'll never get themselves involved in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world." Oh yes? Why not? How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag, serving under the U.N. command in the world today? 3,700. How many Americans? 11. What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates? The Chinese naval contingent. Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation. They want to keep the sea lanes open. Increasingly, we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values, but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests. It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:44	<br><br>
	
And here's the third factor, which is totally different. Today in our modern world, because of the Internet, because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here, everything is connected to everything. We are now interdependent. We are now interlocked, as nations, as individuals, in a way which has never been the case before, never been the case before. The interrelationship of nations, well it's always existed. Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations. But now we are intimately locked together. You get swine flu in Mexico, it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later. Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses. There are fires in the steppes of Russia, food riots in Africa. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:34	<br><br>
	
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected. And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone, not connected with others, not working with others, is no longer a viable proposition. Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself, nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory, because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:06	<br><br>
	
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain. At that time, the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only: how strong was our army, how strong was our air force, how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies. That was when the enemy was outside the walls. Now the enemy is inside the walls. Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country, I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security, I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country, who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings. It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense. It's its capacity to lock together its institutions. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:12	<br><br>
	
And this tells you something very important. It tells you that, in fact, our governments, vertically constructed, constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks, command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely. You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen, is the network. It's your capacity to network that matters, both within your governments and externally. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:40	<br><br>
	
So here is Ashdown's third law. By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it? Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age, where everything is connected to everything, the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others. The most important bit about your structure -- whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment, whether you're a business -- is your docking points, your interconnectors, your capacity to network with others. You understand that in industry; governments don't. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:14	<br><br>
	
But now one final thing. If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before, then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other. Suddenly and for the very first time, collective defense, the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations, is no longer enough. It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe; if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe; my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe. It is no longer the case. The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that, increasingly, I share a destiny with my enemy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:58	<br><br>
	
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s, we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them. Collective security is not enough. Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work. They shared a destiny with their enemies. One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians, do not understand that they share a collective destiny. And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen, what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:41	<br><br>
	
I started with a poem, I'll end with one. The great poem of John Donne's. "Send not for whom the bell tolls." The poem is called "No Man is an Island." And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee." For John Donne, a recommendation of morality. For us, I think, part of the equation for our survival. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:14	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:16	<br><br>

十九世纪末 英国一位着名诗人 写了这样一首诗 在 1930 年时，它被誉为 丘吉尔脑海中的回响 诗是这样的 闲荡夏林间 溪自细细流 遥听远鼓响 鼓乐疑梦音 无常世间道 珍重朋与辈，碾食成粉末 战士踏征途 魂销沙场渺 对诗词有兴趣的朋友 这是豪斯曼的《施罗普希尔的少年》 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:47	<br><br>
	
但豪斯曼感悟些什么呢 和你在尼尔森交响乐中听到的一样 是那19 世纪，又长，又闷热, 平静的夏季森林 即将结束 我们将进入 一个可怕的 权力转变的历史周期 女士先生们，这时代通常会 伴随着动乱 和流血事件 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:14	<br><br>
	
我给你的信息是 我相信我们坐上了同一条船 活在历史洪流中的同一时刻 当你遇上 固有权力的秩序开始改变 新世界 新力量 开始形成 这些 -- 我们今天很清楚看见 都是些超混乱，特艰难的年代 和常有的流血时期。 顺道一提，它大概一世纪出现一次 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:44	<br><br>
	
你也许不认同最后那次的发生时间 C 就是豪斯曼和丘吉尔同时察觉的 欧洲旧国家，旧势力 权力转移到 大西洋对岸 新冒起的美国 开始了美国世纪 当然，在欧洲势力下坡的最后年代 交替的空窗期 出现了两次 屠杀大灾难 前后两次的世界大战 毛泽东称它为欧洲内战 这形容确也贴切 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:19	<br><br>
	
好，女士先生们 我们生活在这当下 为了我们，今天我打算谈谈三个原素 这当中的头一个 是有关权力转移 至于， 第二个我称它为新领域 过去好像都没出现过 我们先说说发生中的权力转移 今天出现的 有点令人惊栗 因为它从没发生过 我们见过权力的横向转移 权力从希腊过渡到罗马 和欧洲社会 出现的权力转移 但我们看到的现状稍异 权力不单是横向 在国与国间游走 它也纵向移动 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:05	<br><br>
	
今天出现的权力转移，更包括 和国家宪法里的 责任和法律的裁决 今天都很大程度搬上了国际舞台 权力全球化 我们讲市场全球化 但真正全球化的是权力 但在国家层面上 权力的层次 是受法律的约束 在国际舞台便不一样 现今国际和环球舞台上的权力属于 互联网、卫星广播 货币兑换 巨额钞票的流转 融资额度约是 贸易需求的32倍 货币兑客, 你可称之为 金融投机家 近来，他们所为相当令人拜服 现今跨国企业的 编制预算的财力 比一般中等国家还要大 生存在国际舞台 绝大部分不受监管 既不受法律规管 行动又不受约束 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
直至现在 都有利权势人士 在无约束下运作 永远适合极权者 但从历史可知，不久将来 没有监管的区域 没有法治的所在 会不断膨胀，不只出现一些你要的东西 如国际贸易，互联网，等等 同时，也会出现些你不要的 国际罪案，国际恐怖主义 911 事件揭示 即使你身在地球上最强势的国家 城市里最具代表性的地标建筑 不管怎样 在九月某个明亮的早晨 那些空间的人民一样能攻击你 据说，经双子塔法团通过的 4 百万元流动资金的 当中约 60%是用来支助 911 事件的 而双子塔就在 9/11 事件中被摧毁 看，我们的敌人也会利用这些空间 集体运输，互联网，卫星广播 来解决他们的毒害 不久，这会毁掉 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:20	<br><br>
	
我们的系统 我们的方式 历史法则是 权力走到那里 管治便要跟到那里 如果这是事实，那我相信 今日社会的其中一个现象 既是权力全球化 那随之而来的挑战，便应是 管治全球化 我相信未来的几十年 将会出现不同程度的骚乱 多少能够成就这个目标 将管治全球化 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
要注意，我谈的不是政府 也不是成立 一些全球化的民主机构 女士先生们, 顺道一提，我个人认为 成立更多联合国类机构 并不能把事办好 如果我们没有这联合国，我们必需成立一个 世界需要一个中介的国际论坛 去合法化国际的联合行动 但当涉及管治全球化时 我估计 通过更多的联合国类机构也没法达成 当权力聚拢的时候才会真正出现 建立一个以条约为基础的系统 以条约为基础的协议 来管治这国际舞台 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:32	<br><br>
	
如你有留意，你会看见它正在发生，慢慢浮现 世界贸易组织就是条约为本的组织 完全以条约为本 在必要时，他的现有势力己足以制衡强国 如美国 京都协议：努力成立 一个条约为本的组织的开始 G20 （20国集团）： 现在我们知道我们要联合起来 组织一个有能力管治 国际金融间投机活动的机构 这便是G20：一个条约为本的机构 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:01	<br><br>
	
现在，问题是， 我们回头再谈这个 如果你集中权力 去建立一个条约为本的机构 去填充管治空间 那，那些没参加的弱国怎么办呢 这可是大问题 稍后再到回这话题 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:20	<br><br>
	
所以，我的第一要点是 如果你身处这混乱年代 不管混乱多还少 要能成功克服 很大程度取决于我们 把合理的管理 引进这国际舞台的能力 并守护它出现 我的第二要点是 我知道我不必向你们 说这种事 但是，权力不单是纵向移动的 它也横向移动 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:50	<br><br>
	
也许你会从文明进化史角度和我争论 文明起源于沿海地带 地中海沿岸是其中之一 西方最近一次的势力增长在大西洋沿岸 这我看来 我们正目睹一幕重要的权力转移 坦白说就是权力从大西洋沿岸国家出走 到太平洋沿岸 现在，首先转移的是经济 也是通常最先出现的 你已经见到 世界上其它正在兴起的势力 发展外交政策，增加国防预算 我认为 这不只是西方转移到东方 有些不一样的正出现 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:31	<br><br>
	
我估计是，姑且这样说 未来的十年，十五年 美国仍然是 地球上最强的国家 但他掌握权力的背景 已经彻底改变 这 50 年 史上最不一样的年头 完全单极的世界 所有政策方向 不管赞成或反对 都以华盛顿为马首 世界由一个大国带领 这不是历史中常见的事 事实上，现在在发生的 反而是历史常见 你开始看到 多极世界的出现 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:14	<br><br>
	
到目前为止 美国担当着世界的领导角色 未来，他仍是最有力的强国 而且会在不断多极化的世界中 成为最强 你开始见到其他权力中心冒起 中国，当然是其中之一 虽然个人认为，中国的崛起之路不会平顺 经济自由化之后 社会开始民主化 这将引起不安 但这是另一议题了 你看印度、巴西 你看到世界不断增加 对我们欧洲人来说 更像 19 世纪的欧洲 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:52	<br><br>
	
伟大的大不列颠外交大臣坎宁勋爵 经常形容19 世纪的欧洲 为 ”欧洲权力音乐会“ 它存在一个五方的平衡 英国常在当中摆动促成它的平衡 如巴黎和柏林联合时 英国便加入另一方的维也纳和罗马 现在留意 当世界被单一势力支配时 会出现固定的联盟 如：北约组织、华沙公约国 一个固定对立的权力 即固定的联盟 但多股对立的权力 却代表联盟会转移和不断改变 这便是我们即将进入的世界 在这我们将见到 盟国不断的离合 大不列颠外交大臣坎宁曾说过 "英国有共同利益" 但没有同盟国 你将会不断见到 虽然我们身在西方 如果我们想在世界上完成任务 终究还是要 踏出大西洋安逸圈 和其它国家结盟 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:50	<br><br>
	
当你进入利比亚，要注意 西方国家不宜单独行动 我们要与其它国家一起 我们需拉拢阿拉伯联盟 我估计伊朗和阿富汗事件 将是西方尝试自行解决的最后一次 但没有成功 我估计 我们已到达 400 年兴盛的末落之门 我说 400 年，因为它是代表西方霸权主义 西方制度和西方价值的 鄂图曼帝国的结束 你知道，到目前为止，如果西方能共同行动 它可以在地球任一角落 提出和处理 但这事实将不会持久 二次大战后 西方联合起来 布列敦森林机构、世界银行、国际货币基金组织 一起应付金融危机 把问题解决 现在，我们要邀请其他国家参与 我们要建立 G20 我们要跨出 西方盟友的安逸圈 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:48	<br><br>
	
让我来为你作一个预测 这可能更令你吃惊 我怀疑我们已经到了 400 年王国的终点 当西方势力充分出现 人们对我说，“中国，当然， 他们从不参与 维持和平行动，世界各地多国的维和行动 喔是吗？为什么呢？ 今日有多少中国军队 在蓝色贝蕾帽和蓝旗下服役 有多少在联合国司令部底下服务 3700 美国呢？ 11 在追击索马里海盗事件中 哪个国家的海军舰队规模最大 是中国海军舰队 当然是中国，他们重视商易 要保持海上航道畅通 愈来愈多地，我们不得不与一些 没有共同价值观 但在那刻，有共同兴趣的人通商 这是一个全新的方式 看待今日新兴的世界 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:44	<br><br>
	
接下来，第三个 完全不同的因素 今天我们的现代社会 因为互联网 因为人们在这里谈论各种事情 每件事都互相串联起来 人们互相依赖 互相连结 作为国家，个人 以一种前所未有的方法 连结起来 国与国之间的关系 呀，它总是存在的 外交便是管理国与国之间的邦交 但现在，我们亲密地锁在一起 你在墨西哥染上猪流感 24 小时后，它便成为 戴高乐机场的问题 雷曼兄弟倒闭，拖垮整个经济体 俄罗斯大草原大火 非洲随之会出现食物骚乱 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:34	<br><br>
	
现在，所有人都被层层捆绑环扣 这代表着什么呢 一个国家闭关自守 不与人联系 不与人合作 不再是可行的提案 因为，一个国家的行动 不再受限于该国本身 或他是否有足够的能力 控制他的属土 亦因为国外的影响 已开始反过来影响国内 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:06	<br><br>
	
我年轻时是个军人 曾参与不列颠帝国最后一场小战事 当时，我国的国防 只关注一件事，一件而已 就是我们的陆军有多强，我们的空军有多强 我们的海军有多强和我们的联合部队有多强 那是敌人在墙外的年代 今天，敌人己在墙内 现在，如果我要谈国防 我要去跟卫生部长说 因为流行病威胁我们的安全 我要去跟农业部长说 因为食品安全威胁我们的安全 我要跟工业部长说 因为我们脆弱的高端科技设施 在网络战争里 成为敌人的攻击点 我要跟内政部长说 因为他们已经进入我们国内 住在市中心区的排屋 对国内发生的事有直接影响 就像伦敦的七七爆炸案 国家安全已经不再单纯是 军队和国防部长的事 它把所有部门扣连在一起 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:12	<br><br>
	
这现象告诉你一些非常重要的 事实，它告诉你 我们政府的垂直架构 是依工业革命的经济模式建构 部门分工，上下分级， 上令下达的结构 已经完全不宜 你从商贸里知道 女士先生们，我们当前的结构模式， 是网络 在政府内外 结合联网的能力 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:40	<br><br>
	
这便是我的阿什当第三定律 顺道说，请别问我有关阿什当第一和第二定律 因为我还没草拟出来 第三定律，总是比较好听，对吗？ 阿什当第三定律便是现世代 每件事都互相关连 取决你能干什么的最重要因素是 你究竟能联合他人干些什么 不管你是一个政府，还是军团 或是一盘生意 架构的重点 便是你的接入点，你的内部连结 你和其他人连系的能力 你从工作中了解了这点 但政府却不懂 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:14	<br><br>
	
最后要说一件事 如果事情真是这样，女士先生们 我们现在正以一种前所未有的方式 串连一起 也就是说，我们有着相同的命运 突然的，第一次的 一向认为集体防务 确保国家安全的观念 已经不再足够 过去通常 如果我的民族比别的民族强，我们是安全的 如果我的国家比别的国家强，我们是安全的 我们的联盟，如北约组织，比别的联盟强，我们是安全的 现在已经不再是这回事 随着彼此联系的出现 和大量杀伤力武器的面世 日益意味着 我和敌人面对同一处境 	<br><br>

当我七零年代驻日内瓦 做外交官时 我们成功与苏联达成裁军协议 因为我们明白 我们与他们在同一天空下 集体安全并不足够 北爱尔兰可以达至和平 是因为双方知道零和游戏不行 他们和敌人遭遇相同 中东和平的其中一大障碍 我想是以色列和巴勒斯坦双方 都不明白 他们面对着同一的命运 女士先生们，非常突然地 无论是有远见的智者或敏感细腻的诗人 他们都建议 我们必须认真 视之为公共政策问题 	<br><br>

我以一首诗开始，亦将会以一首诗结束 约翰.多恩的伟大诗篇 诗题是《没有人能独存》 诗是这样写的 钟鸣知为谁 每个人的离去，都影响着 同为人的我 忐忑未敢问 钟究为谁鸣 钟为故人鸣 约翰.多恩 - 一个道德的推崇者 我想，对我们来说 那只是生存方程式的部分 	<br><br>

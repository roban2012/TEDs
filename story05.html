Why, why, why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago? Millions of students were failing then, as they are now ― and it’s because we’re clinging to a business model that clearly doesn’t work. Education advocate Geoffrey Canada dares the system to look at the data, think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel. 	<br><br>

I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me, she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:19	<br><br>
	
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- " 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:22	<br><br>
	
I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:24	<br><br>
	
She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:31	<br><br>
	
So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey, I'm gonna be good. I am." But I am angry. (Laughter) And the last time I looked, I'm -- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:42	<br><br>
	
(Applause) So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. This year, there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose, that we could -- right now, we could save them all. You saw the quality of the educators who were here. Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them. I know they could. It is absolutely possible. Why haven't we fixed this? Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail, we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work, and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? -- enough to say, "Enough is enough." So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:40	<br><br>
	
You know, I grew up in the inner city, and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school, and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later. And you know something about a lousy school? It's not like a bottle of wine. Right? (Laughter) Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right? That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year, it's still the same approach, right? One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't, tough luck. Just tough luck. Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen? Do not tell me we can't do better than this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years, and you say, "So what's the plan?" And they say, "We'll, we're going to do what we did last year this year." What kind of business model is that? Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3. They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour. Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed. They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. Who created that business model? Right? And it went on for decades. You know why? Because they didn't care. It wasn't about the customers. It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. How could you go to the bank when you were at work? It didn't matter. And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank. They all operate the same way. Right? Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea. Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. They might like that. What about a Saturday? What about introducing technology? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old. So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology, and when they first came out with those new contraptions, these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money, I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right. I am never using that, right?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:09	<br><br>
	
So technology has changed. Things have changed. Yet not in education. Why? Why is it that when we had rotary phones, when we were having folks being crippled by polio, that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now? And if you come up with a plan to change things, people consider you radical. They will say the worst things about you. I said one day, well, look, if the science says -- this is science, not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there. You look at them in September, they've gone down. You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study." Because it suggests we should do something. (Laughter) Every 10 years they reproduce the same study. It says exactly the same thing: Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules? For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School. I thought I knew something. They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had ― but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense. I never got that. I never got that, because anyone knows if you farm, you don't plant crops in July and August. You plant them in the spring. So who came up with this idea? Who owns it? Why did we ever do it? Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have, schools were open all year. They were open all year, because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. They didn't have any place for their kids to go. It was a perfect place to have schools. So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:11	<br><br>
	
So why don't we? Why don't we? Because our business has refused to use science. Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying, "Look, this works, right? We can do this." How many places in America are going to change? None. None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right? Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing. As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:42	<br><br>
	
Here's what we know. We know that the problem begins immediately. Right? This idea, zero to three. My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids, three grown ones and a 15-year-old. That's a longer story. (Laughter) With our first kids, we did not know the science about brain development. We didn't know how critical those first three years were. We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. We didn't know the role that language, a stimulus and response, call and response, how important that was in developing those children. We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing. Wealthy people know. Educated people know. And their kids have an advantage. Poor people don't know, and we're not doing anything to help them at all. But we know this is critical. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:38	<br><br>
	
Now, you take pre-kindergarten. We know it's important for kids. Poor kids need that experience. Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist. We know health services matter. You know, we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about, you know, because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff, but we do health services, and I have to raise a lot of money. People used to say when they'd come fund us, "Geoff, why do you provide these health services?" I used to make stuff up. Right? I'd say, "Well, you know a child who has cavities is not going to, uh, be able to study as well." And I had to because I had to raise the money. But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them? You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts? Because I actually like kids. I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy, I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid." And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better, but you will give that kid dance instruction, and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction, and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
So here's the other thing. I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information, because you work at something, you think it's working, and you find out it's not working. I mean, you're educators. You work, you say, you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it. But here's the problem with testing. The testing that we do -- we're going to have our test in New York next week ― is in April. You know when we're going to get the results back? Maybe July, maybe June. And the results have great data. They'll tell you Raheem really struggled, couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data, but you're getting it back after school is over. And so, what do you do? You go on vacation. (Laughter) You come back from vacation. Now you've got all of this test data from last year. You don't look at it. Why would you look at it? You're going to go and teach this year. So how much money did we just spend on all of that? Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. I need that data in September. I need that data in November. I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that. I need to know that this week. I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:41	<br><br>
	
Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant. I can predict school scores. You take me to any school. I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level. And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do from last year to this year?" You say, "We're doing the same thing." I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter) This year, somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level. And I will be right every single time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:18	<br><br>
	
So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what? Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:32	<br><br>
	
So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. We can't stifle innovation in our business. We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation. They get angry if you do something different. If you try something new, people are always like, "Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see. This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years. Let's try something different. And here's the rub. Some of it's not going to work. You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work." A lot of them don't. They should be closed. I mean, I really believe they should be closed. But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything. Right? Because that's not the way the world works. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
If you think about technology, imagine if that's how we thought about technology. Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right? You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot. They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing." That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul. The folks went out there. They kept inventing. The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:06	<br><br>
	
Our job as educators, there's some stuff we know that we can do. And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier, we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. We've got to give them all of these opportunities. So that we have to do. But this innovation issue, this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:32	<br><br>
	
And this is something, by the way, that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right. We have run out of time. I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second, and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this ― So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars. What is five billion dollars to the United States? What did we spend in Afghanistan this year? How many trillions? (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
When the country cares about something, we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. When the safety of America is threatened, we will spend any amount of money. The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about. I dare say it's a pittance, what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:51	<br><br>
	
So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter) So, you guys, help me get there. Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:14	<br><br>
	
John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John, 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. A hundred percent of them went to college. This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school. Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college. We'd better get that other seven percent. So that's just how this goes. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:41	<br><br>
	
JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:43	<br><br>
	
GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids, the same kids, these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school, they drop out in record numbers. And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does. They harass you, right? They call you, they say, "I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test? What are you talking about that you want to leave school? And you're not coming back here." So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school. But I'm not kidding about some of this, and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. When kids know that you refuse to let them fail, it puts a different pressure on them, and they don't give up as easy. So sometimes they don't have it inside, and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this, but I know my mother's going to be mad." Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through. We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support, but also a set of encouragements that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard, but we refuse to let you fail." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:53	<br><br>
	
JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada. Please give it up for him one more time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:56	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
我有点紧张，因为我的妻子Yvonne对我说： “Geoff, 你看TED演讲的，对吧？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
我说:"对啊，亲爱的，我喜欢TED演讲。" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:19	<br><br>
	
她说：“那些演讲者可都是很聪明、很有才能的人哦！” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:22	<br><br>
	
我说：“这我知道、知道。” （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:24	<br><br>
	
她说：“那观众不会喜欢你这个怒气冲冲的黑老头吧？” （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:31	<br><br>
	
因此，我对她说：”放心好了，我不会发火的，亲爱的！“ ”我会控制我的情绪的，我会的！” 可是，我还是火大了。（笑声） 最后我还是生气了不是？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:42	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 这就是我兴奋的原因，可我还是生气了。 今年，将会有成百上千万的学生 完全没必要地，在我们的手中流失， 而其实，我们现在还可以拉他们一把的。 我们的师资质量各位是有目共睹的。 你可别对我说我们的教育工作者没法帮那些孩子 和拉他们一把。我知道，他们可以的。 他们完全可以做到的。 可为什么我们没去做这件事呢？ 我们有些教育工作者已经习惯墨守成规 我们不太在乎有几百万的学生学无所成， 而我们还乐此不疲地继续做着那些无用功， 而从来都没有人因此生过气，发过火，对不？ 这些足够我说：“我受够了” 所以，我想讲一下这种毫无意义的教育模式 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:40	<br><br>
	
要知道，我是在市区长大的， 当时，很多学生在学业上就已经一事无成了 那可是在56年前，当时我刚开始读书， 而那些学校在56年后的今天仍然还很糟糕、很烂。 各位知道烂了这么多年的学校的是什么样子的吗？ 这可不像陈年老酒（年份越老越好）。 对吧？（笑声） 如果是陈酒，1987年的就是一瓶好酒，对吧？ 我的意思是说我们的学校 年复一年地在使用相同的教学方法，对吧？ 千人一面的，如果它适合你，那还好，但如果不合适呢 那你可要倒大霉了――你肯定会倒大霉的。 可我们为什么不创新呢？ 你可别告诉我：“没有什么比现在的体系更好的了。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:31	<br><br>
	
想想看，你进入一所50年来从没有让学生们学有所成的学校 你问校方：“你们的教学计划是什么？” 他们告诉你：“我们今年的教学计划 和去年的一样。” 那是一种什么样的运作模式啊？ 过去，银行的营业时间一般是上午10点到下午3点。 他们上午10点到下午3点营业，可午餐时还关门。 但谁会在上午10点到下午3点之间上银行呢？ 除非他是无业游民。 可这些人不需要银行啊。他们没钱存银行。 那是谁创造了这种业务模式呢？是吧？ 可就这样，它也运作了好几十年。 为什么呢？因为他们不在乎我们。 他们不在乎顾客。 这是银行家们的事。它们只为自己着想。 在上班时间 你怎么可能去银行呢？ 可是，没关系。 他们不在乎我Geoff是否因为不能在这个时间段去银行 而感到爽与不爽。你可以去找另一家银行啊， 可所有银行都是这样的营业时间啊，对吧？ 然后，某一天，某个疯子银行家突发奇想--- 或许我们应该在人们不上班的时间也对外营业吧。 顾客们可能会喜欢这样子的呢。星期六（营业）怎么样呢？ 又或者，引入新技术怎么样呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:48	<br><br>
	
我是一个技术发烧友，但我得承认 我年纪是大了点。 所以，我会有点跟不上形势，我也不相信技术， 尤其是我第一次看到的新玩意儿―― 就是这些你将银行卡塞进去就能给你吐出钱来的自动取款机 我想，这些机器没法数准这些钱吧！ 我从没用过取款机。对吧？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:09	<br><br>
	
其实技术已经变了很多，世上的事情也在变。 可就是教育从来没变过。为什么？ 为何在我们还使用旋转式拨号电话机时， 当我们还有人因脊髓灰质炎而至残跛行时， 我们所受的教育 和现在的孩子所受的教育还是完全一样的呢？ 而如果你有计划做一些改革， 人们又会说你激进。 他们还会讲你很多坏话。 我曾说过，某天，如果科学说： 是科学――而不是我――使得我们最贫穷的孩子 在夏天里像一盘散沙一般没学上―― 六月时可能你发觉他成绩还不错的，然后你会说，没事啊，他们成绩还可以的。 可等你在九月开学再看到他们时，他们的成绩已经一落千丈了。 你会说，哇！所以，在1975年我听到这样说法 当时我还在哈佛的Ed学校。 我说，“哇，这是一个很重要的研究" 因为这表明我们应该做些事情来改变这一状况。 （笑声） 每10年他们都会重复这一研究。 说的还是同样的事： 穷学生在暑假时学业会一落千丈。 我们的教育体系决定了我们的学校暑假不上课。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:25	<br><br>
	
我一直都挺郁闷的，到底是谁制定这样的臭规定啊？ 多年以来，我一直会去哈佛的Ed学校。 我想我还是了解一些情况的。 他们说，这样规定是因为农时的问题，人们...... 但让我来告诉你，为什么这种说法站不住脚。 我从来不相信这些鬼话， 因为，人所共知，如果你务过农， 你不会在七、八月份播种的。 你应该在春天播种。 那是谁想到这样的借口的呢？始作俑者是谁呢？ 我们以前为什么一直这样做了呢？ 事实上，在19世纪40年代，我们确实还有 全年上课的学校的。这些学校整年都在上课， 这是因为我们有太多的人要整天工作， 他们又没有地方安置自己的孩子。 而学校是一个最合适不过的地方。 所以，这并不是什么 教育圣人定的金科玉律。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:11	<br><br>
	
所以，我们为什么不可以做一下变通？为什么不呢？ 因为我们这个行业拒绝运用科学。 拒绝科学！我们来听听比尔・盖茨是怎么训的， “看，这真的管用，是吧？ 我们可以这样做。” 在美国会有多少地方会改变这种现行的教育制度呢？ 一个也没有。 没有，好吧！可我真见过两个，信不？ 对，在某一个地方会有这种事，因为有些人会做正确的事。 作为教育工作者，我们必须停止这样做。科学是很清晰的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:42	<br><br>
	
以下是我们所知道的东西。 我们知道，问题很快就会来的。 对吧？ 我们来谈谈婴儿从出生到三岁的变化情况。 我的妻子Yvonne和我一共育有四个子女， 其中三个已经成年，还有一个已经15岁了。 说来话长，呵呵。 （笑声） 第一个孩子出生时，我们不了解 小孩子大脑发育方面的科学知识。 我们也不知道这头三年是如此的重要。 我们不清楚这三年这些孩子大脑中发生了什么。 我们不知道语言、 刺激和反应、呼唤和回应这些因素 在小孩成长中有多重要。 而这些东西我们现在全部研究清楚了。 可我们有为此做过什么事吗？ 也没有。 可富人们知道，受过良好教育的人们也知道。 而且他们自己的孩子也拥有某些优势。 可穷人们不知道， 而我们又没有做任何事来帮助他们。 但我们知道这很重要。 	<br><br>

现在我们有学前班。 我们知道学前班对小孩子很重要。 穷人家的孩子也需要这一体验。 可是没有。很多穷地方根本没有学前班。 我们知道健康服务很重要。 你知道的，我们提供健康服务， 人们总认为我是大惊小怪的人， 因为我喜欢问责和数据 和所有好东西，但我们有健康服务， 我必须筹措大量的资金。 过去，常有人说他们会资助我们， “Geoff，你为什么不提供这些健康服务呢？” 我过去常常编造一些鬼话搪塞他们。 我常说：“一个小孩子 如果有太多的蛀牙， 他就不能管好自己的学习。" 我要筹措资金就必须编这些鬼话来搪塞他们。 但现在我老了，你知道我是怎么和他们说的吗？ 你知道我为什么为这些小孩提供这些健康服务、 运动、娱乐、和艺术吗？ 这是因为我喜欢小孩子。 我是真的喜欢他们。（笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:43	<br><br>
	
但是当他们变得有进取心时，我们就会变得更有进取心， 我说：“我这样做就像你们为自己的儿子做的原因一样。” 可能你从未看过麻省理工学院的一份报告，报告说 教你的小孩舞蹈 会对你孩子的代数学习大有裨益。 但你会教那些孩子舞蹈， 而你也会很兴奋地发现学生喜欢学舞蹈， 那这样子你就会觉得有点成就感。那为什么穷学生 就不能有相同的机会呢？ 对这帮孩子来说，这是最基本的东西呢。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:15	<br><br>
	
还有， 我是一名测试论的支持者。我相信你需要数据和信息， 因为你可能在做你认为有用的事， 然后你发现其实它并没有多大用处。 我是说，你们是教育工作者。你会说，我在做事情啊， 你认为你做了应该做的事，不是吗？ 然后你发现学生没学到其想要的东西。 可是，就算是测试也有很多有待改善的问题。 我们给学生的考试―― 比如说，下周纽约州又准备考试了。 现在是四月， 可你知道我们什么时候才知道考试结果吗？ 可能要等到七月，也可能是六月。 而考试结果里面含有大量的数据， 比如说，他们会告诉你如Raheen的学习有困难， 他做不了两位数的乘法――这数据多有价值啊， 可当你拿到这些数据时已经放暑假了。 那你怎么会利用好这些数据呢？ 你都去度假了。（笑声） 等你度假归来， 你拿到这些上学期的测试数据 你连看都不会看了。 你怎么会看呢？ 因为你又要准备新学期的功课了。 所以，你看我们在这些无谓的事情上浪费了多少资金？ 那可是成亿美元的资金啊 就为那些来得太迟而我们无法使用的所谓数据。 我九月需要那些数据， 我十一月需要那些数据， 我需要知道你学习上有什么困难，我需要知道 是否我采取的措施能补救学生学习上的不足。 我需要知道这些，考完试的这周就需要。 我不希望在学年结束时才拿到这些数据，因为那太迟了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:41	<br><br>
	
到了我这把年纪，我可以说是已经开了慧眼了。 我可以很容易地预测到某所学校的成绩的。 只要你把我带到任何一所学校。 我尤其善于预测市区那些办学水平不怎么样的学校。 只要你告诉我去年学校有48%的学生取得 及格以上的学业成绩就行。 我会问：“那你们今年的计划是什么？你采取的措施 和去年的有什么不同？” 如果你告诉我：“我们和去年的做法差不多。” 那我就可以帮你预测一下了。（笑声） 今年，你的及格以上的人数大约在 44%到52%之间。 而我每次的预测都全中。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:18	<br><br>
	
我们花了这么多钱，可我们得到了些什么？ 老师们需要的是及时的信息和数据 ――关于他们的学生学习真实情况的数据啊。 不过，亡羊补牢为时不晚， 因为我们还可以为此做些事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:32	<br><br>
	
由此我想到了另外一个问题， 我们得关心这个事情。 在教育改革中，我们不能扼杀创新。 我们必须创新。可我们很多人会对创新抱抵触的情绪。 如果你要做些改变他们会很不爽。 如果你想尝试些新东西，总会有人说： “哦，又弄来一间特许的实验学校了。” 但至少你让我们来做些尝试吧。 我们现行的制度55年来都没起什么作用啊。 让我们来尝试些新的东西行不行呢？可这也有难处。 有些特许的实验学校也不成功。 要知道，也有人告诉我： “唉，那些特许学校有很多也是不成功的啊。” 那些不成功的学校，就应该关掉。 说实话，我真的认为它们应该关掉。 但我们不能将科学 和那些不起作用的东西混在一起， 然后说，我们什么也不用做啊。 是吧？因为这个世界本来就不是那样子的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:23	<br><br>
	
如果我们来看一看技术， 试想如果这就是我们对技术的看法―― 每次如果有什么东西没有用， 我们就放弃，就说：“算了，没用的。” 这样行吗？ 他们想说服我。我想你们当中有些人也曾和我一样―― 当时有一台最新款的、最好的东西――掌上电脑。 他们告诉我：“Geoff，如果你有了这台掌上电脑， 你就什么别的东西都不想要了。” 但是，那东西我只用了三个星期就坏了。 我为我把钱花在这种玩意身上而懊恼不已。 可有任何人因为这样就不去发明了吗？不会，绝对不会的。 人们会不断地去发明、去创新。 失败不能阻止你 将科学推向进步。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:06	<br><br>
	
作为教育工作者， 我们知道我们可以做些事情。 我们要做得更好。我们要在低年级的孩子中做教育评估， 我们得确保我们对年轻人提供了足够的支持。 我们要给他们足够的机会。 这是我们应该做的。但是创新呢？ 我们还是要继续创新的， 直到我们打下坚实的科学基础。 这是重中之重的事。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:32	<br><br>
	
顺便说一句，我认为 这对我们所有的教育工作者来说都是一种巨大的挑战。 美国不能再等50年再来将这些我们做错的事情改过来， 我们耗不起这个时间。 我不懂财政危机什么的，但我知道 我们当下正面临着严峻的教育危机。 如果我们继续容忍这些人做蠢事， 然后说我们没法做这些事―― 因为，比尔・盖茨说，这要耗掉美国50亿美元。 50亿美元对美国来说是什么概念呢？ 知道我们今年在阿富汗花了多少钱吗？ 到底我们花了多少万亿美元呢？（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
当一个国家在乎一些事了， 我们就算花一万亿美元也不会眨一下眼睛的。 当美国的安全受到威胁时， 多少钱我们都会花。 我们国家的真正安全 在于下一代的人才储备， 这样他们才能接好我们的班， 成为世界的领导者。 能在思想、技术和民主 和所有我们关心的事情上面做到最好。 我敢说，只要非常微薄的一点钱， 就能让我们真正 着手处理这些事，解决这些问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:51	<br><br>
	
所以，如果我们做好了这些事，我就不会再生气了。（笑声） 所以，各位，请帮帮忙，帮我做好这些事。 谢谢大家！谢谢。 （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:14	<br><br>
	
现在哈林儿童区的中学生的辍学率是多少呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
约翰，实际上 我们的学生现在100%都读到中学毕业。 这是我校去年的数据。 去年他们100%去升入大学继续学业。 今年的高中生毕业率也将达到100%。 上次我听说有93%的学生能上大学。 但我们还要让那7%也读上大学。 这也就是我要生气的原因了。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:41	<br><br>
	
那他们高中毕业后你是如何追踪他们的呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:43	<br><br>
	
你知道，美国有很多很糟糕的问题， 其中之一就是，这些没读上大学的孩子， 这些来自弱势群体的孩子，你招他们入学后， 他们大量地辍学。 因此，我们已经弄明白了你得真正去设计 一个用各种方法去帮助这些孩子的网络， 就像孩子们的父母们为孩子们做的一样。 比如说，家长会干涉你的，对吧？ 他们会打电话给你，他们会说： “我想看一下你的成绩。 你上次考试考了多少分？” 如果你都不想读书了， 你不会再回到学校了，你还能说些什么呢？” 所以，我的很多学生知道，你不能再回到哈林儿童区了 因为Geoff那个家伙在到处找你。 就好像：“我真的不能回去的。” 其实不然，这类学生最好还是呆在学校。 我这不是开玩笑的， 而这就会碰触到我想谈的核心问题。 当孩子们知道你不想他们失败时， 这无形中会给他们一种不同的压力， 他们就不会轻言放弃了。 所以，有时他们并不是发自内心的自己想追求进步， 而是，正如他们自己所说的：“我不想做这些事的 但我知道，我不做我妈妈会生气的。” 这对孩子来说很重要，这会帮助他们渡过很多难关。 我们会想方法为他们创设一系列的策略来辅导他们、 帮助他们和支持他们，同时给他们以足够的鼓励， 比如：“你行的。尽管会有些困难， 但我们不会让你学无所成的。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:53	<br><br>
	
好的。谢谢你，Canada博士。 请各位再次将掌声送给Canada博士。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Learn to read Chinese ... with ease!</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
For foreigners, learning to speak Chinese is a hard task. But learning to read the beautiful, often complex characters of the Chinese written language may be less difficult. ShaoLan walks through a simple lesson in recognizing the ideas behind the characters and their meaning ― building from a few simple forms to more complex concepts. Call it Chineasy. 	<br><br>
ShaoLan Hsueh	<br><br>
	
   May 2013 	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:53	<br><br>
	
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy. The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:42	<br><br>
	
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:40	<br><br>
	
I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. Three trees together, we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire? Two fires together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together, prosperous. Three together, that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home? This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman. Two women together, they have an argument. (Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:43	<br><br>
	
So we have gone through almost 30 characters. By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old. So after we know the characters, we start building phrases. For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. A person behind Japan, what do we get? A Japanese person. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. 	<br><br>

我在台湾长大。 作为一位书法家的女儿， 我最珍贵的记忆之一 是妈妈为我展示了 汉字的形意之美。 从那时起， 我开始着迷于这美妙的语言。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
但对于门外汉来说， 汉字就跟中国的长城一样 高不可攀。 过去几年，我一直思考 如何能够攻克这堵墙， 让那些要理解和欣赏 这复杂语言优雅地方的人， 可以这样做。 我开始思考，如何创造一种新的、 快速的方法， 有助于学习汉字。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:53	<br><br>
	
从五岁起，我开始学习 如何按照正确顺序、一笔一划的 书写每个汉字。 在十五年期间， 我每天都学习新的汉字。 因为我们只有五分钟时间， 最好有一个更简易便捷的学习方式。 一位中文学者认识二万个汉字， 你只需认识一千个汉字， 就可看懂简单的文学作品。 认识顶部二百个汉字， 让你看明白百分之四十的基本文献―― 足以读懂路标、餐厅菜单、 以了解中文网页的基本想法 或报纸内容。 今天我用八个汉字 来展示这个方法如何有效。 大家准备好了吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:42	<br><br>
	
把你的嘴张得越大越好， 直到变成正方形。 这就是一个“口“字。 这是一个人正在散步。 “人”字。 “火”字的形状就是 一个人在两边有两只胳膊， 好像她正在大喊大叫： “救命啊！我着火了！” ―― 实际上，这符号最初 来自于火苗的形状， 但是我喜欢那方法。 大家随便选。 这是一棵树木。 "木"。 这是一座"山"。 "日"。 "月"。 “T”的符号 就像狂野西部片里轿车上的一对门。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:40	<br><br>
	
我称这八个字为基本字， 它们是一堆组件， 以创造出很多其他的字。 一个“人”。 如果另一个人走在后面， 意思就是“跟随”。 有句谚语， 二人为从，三人为众。 如果有个人打开双臂， 这个人说：「它有这么大。」 把“人”放在“口”里，这个人被困住了。 他就变成了"囚"徒， 就像约拿被困在鲸鱼肚子里。 一棵树是"木"。 两棵树在一起，就是“树林”。 三棵树在一起，就是“森林”。 把一块木板放在树下面， 我们就有了“基本”。 把一张嘴放在树上，那是“呆子”。 (笑声) 记起来非常容易， 因为一棵会说话的树 是很呆傻的事情。 还记得“火”吗？ 两团“火”在一起，就变得非常“炎热”了。 三团“火”在一起，就是“焱”， 非常多的火焰。 把火放在两棵树下， 就会“焚烧”。 对于我们来说， 太阳是一切生机的来源。 两个太阳在一起，就是“昌”盛。 三个太阳在一起， 那就“闪闪发光亮晶晶”。 当太阳和月亮在一起闪耀时， 那就是“光明”。 一个白天一个夜晚之后，就是"明天"。 太阳正从地平线上升起。“旦”。 一扇“门”。在门里放块木板， 就是“门闩”。 把一张嘴放在门里，就是“问”。 “砰砰”，有人在家吗？ 这人正要溜出门口， “躲闪”，“逃避”。 左边，我们有一个女人。 两个女人在一起，准会有场争论。 （笑声） 三个女人在一起，要小心，就是通""。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:43	<br><br>
	
我们已经学了差不多三十个汉字， 通过这个方法，这八个基本字 可以衍生出三十二个汉字， 下一组的八个汉字 又会衍生出另外32个汉字。 所以，大家很轻松地 就可学到几百个汉字， 这相当于八岁中国孩子的汉语程度。 在学过了这些字后，我们开始学习造词组。 比如，把“山”和“火”放在一起， 我们有“火山”。这是“火山”。 我们知道日本是太阳升起的地方。 这里把太阳和原点放在一起， 因为日本位于中国的东面。 所以把太阳和原点放在一起，就是“日本”。 在“日本”后面加个“人”，我们得到什么？ “日本人”。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:32	<br><br>
	
左边的字有两座山， 上下叠在一起。 在古代中国，这意味着流亡， 因为中国的皇帝把政敌 流放到大山之外。 现今，“流放”变成了“走出去”。 一个“口”字告诉你从哪里出去， 就是“出口”。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:55	<br><br>
	
这张幻灯片提醒我，该结束演讲了， 并走下台。谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">The economic case for preschool</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In this well-argued talk, Timothy Bartik makes the macro-economic case for preschool education ― and explains why you should be happy to invest in it, even if you don't have kids that age (or kids at all). The economic benefits of well-educated kids, it turns out, go well beyond the altruistic.	<br><br>
Timothy Bartik	<br><br>
 May 2013 	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:12	<br><br>
	
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment. It's a different idea, because usually, when people talk about early childhood programs, they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants, in preschool, they have better K-12 test scores, better adult earnings. Now that's all very important, but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:49	<br><br>
	
And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs, we need to interest state governments in this. The federal government has a lot on its plate, and state governments are going to have to step up. So we have to appeal to them, the legislators in the state government, and turn to something they understand, that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy. Now, by promoting economic development, I don't mean anything magical. All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:33	<br><br>
	
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development, they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs. I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs. I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues, a lot of legislators about these issues. When legislators and others think about economic development, what they first of all think about are business tax incentives, property tax abatements, job creation tax credits, you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place. So for example, states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants. They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks. Now, those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions, and the way they can make sense is, by creating more and better jobs, they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents. So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:35	<br><br>
	
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing, create more and better jobs, but in a different way. It's a somewhat more indirect way. These programs can promote more and better jobs by, you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool, it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around, and, in turn, that higher-quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:12	<br><br>
	
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this. Okay. If you look at the research evidence -- that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment, wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults, you take those known effects, you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out, and you take research on how much skills drive job creation, you will conclude, from these three separate lines of research, that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs, the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 78 cents, so that's a three-to-one return. Now you can get much higher returns, of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits, if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state, but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers, and it's the states that are going to have to act. So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:33	<br><br>
	
Now, one objection you often hear, or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is, why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children? What's in it for me? And the trouble with that objection, it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent. Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that there are huge spillovers of skills -- that when other people's children get more skills, that actually increases the prosperity of everyone, including people whose skills don't change. So for example, numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas, it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages; it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area. So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost. I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley. It's not exactly a low-cost proposition. They are growing because they have high levels of skills. So when we invest in other people's children, and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth of a metro area. As another example, if we look at what determines an individual's wages, and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages, we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part, on that individual's education, for example whether or not they have a college degree. One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition, we find that even once we hold constant, statistically, the effect of your own education, the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages. So specifically, if you hold constant your education, you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area, you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all. In fact, this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree, the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects. So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars. There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area, and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person, but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area, you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars. That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:58	<br><br>
	
Now, what's going on here? What can explain these huge spillover effects of education? Well, let's think about it this way. I can be the most skilled person in the world, but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills, my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology, new production techniques. So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive. They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages. Even if everyone at my firm has good skills, if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills, my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets. And again, the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages, and then, particularly in high-tech businesses, they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses. So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm, but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area. So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality, we not only help those children, we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:23	<br><br>
	
Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out. So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus, Ohio, but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will, for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and become Wolverines. And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes. And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out. Well, the reality is, if you look at the data, Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume. The data is that over 60 percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in, over 60 percent. That percentage does not vary much from state to state. It doesn't vary much with the state's economy, whether it's depressed or booming, it doesn't vary much over time. So the reality is, if you invest in kids, they will stay. Or at least, enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:46	<br><br>
	
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way, pay off in higher adult skills. There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy. So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling. So what are the barriers to getting it done? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:29	<br><br>
	
Well, one obvious barrier is cost. So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four, the total annual national cost would be roughly 30 billion dollars. So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money. On the other hand, if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million, we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to 100 dollars per capita. Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do. It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. And, of course, as I mentioned, this cost has corresponding benefits. I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three, 2.78, for the state economy, in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings. And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something, what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid, that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career, just doing the preschool, not improving K-12 or anything else after that, not doing anything with college tuition or access, just directly improving preschool, and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids. So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
Now, that's one barrier. I actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs. So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce, and thereby increasing economic development. Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds, we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not. So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years, and of course America is notorious for being a short term-oriented society. Now one response you can make to this, and I sometimes have done this in talks, is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs, there are benefits, parents care about preschool, maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool, and I think those are true, but in some sense they're missing the point. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
Ultimately, this is something we're investing in now for the future. And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question. I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately not an economic question, it's a moral question: Are we willing, as Americans, are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids, but our community? Are we still capable of that as a country? And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves. Is that something that you are still invested in, that you still believe in the notion of investment? That is the notion of investment. You sacrifice now for a return later. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:15	<br><br>
	
So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong. However, the moral and political choice is still up to us, as citizens and as voters. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:34	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>

在今天的演讲里，我想陈述一个不同的观点 关于为什么投资儿童的学龄前教育 可以被看做为一种公共投资。 这是一个不同的观点，因为经常 人们谈论儿童学龄前教育方案时 他们探讨的是接受了学前教育的孩子是否 比没有接受学前教育的孩子做得更好 他们从小学到高中有更好的成绩 成年之后有更高的收入。 的确这些都很重要 但我想讨论的是学前教育如何影响 各州的经济 并且促进各州的经济发展。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:49	<br><br>
	
这其实是很关键的 因为如果我们想要提高对 儿童学龄前教育计划的投资 我们就需要各州政府对它感兴趣。 联邦政府有很多问题需要解决 所以各州政府需要向前迈一步。 于是我们需要呼吁他们 各州的立法者们 并且转换成他们理解的东西 他们需要促进他们州的 经济发展。 我所说的促进经济发展 并不是什么神奇的东西。 我只是想说明，儿童学龄前教育 可以为各州带来更多与更好的工作 也因此能够提高各州居民的 人均收入。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:33	<br><br>
	
现在，我认为一般人在谈及 各个州和地方经济发展时 他们大多不会想到这会跟当地的 儿童看护和早教计划有什么关系。 而我了解，我的整个职业生涯都在研究这些计划 我与很多州际经济发展机构负责人 讨论过这些问题 也与许多立法者讨论过。 当立法者和其他人思考关于经济发展时 他们首先想到营业税优惠政策 减免财产税， 创造就业机会税收抵免 正如你所知，这类计划多到数不清 例如，各州对在吸引新建汽车厂 或扩展汽车厂项目上竞争非常激烈。 他们给予各种各样的营业税减免政策。 这些计划能够达到预期效果 取决于他们是否吸引了新的制造厂来到本地 而吸引投资和制造业的目的 就是创造更多与更好的工作， 提高就业率，提高居民人均收入。 这对于当地的居民是有好处的 虽然他们也需要付出一些代价 他们需要承担那些减免的营业税 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:35	<br><br>
	
我的观点是儿童学龄前教育在本质上 可以达到一样的效果 创造更多更好的工作，但用另外一种方法 这是一个间接的方法 这些计划可以带来更多更好的工作 如果我们投资建立高质量的学前教育 它会提高当地劳动力的技能 如果这些孩子们有足够的人留在当地 那么这些更高质量的劳动人口 将会成为当地创造新的工作机会的主力 并成为提高当地社区人均收入水平的中坚力量。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:12	<br><br>
	
接下来让我给你们展示一些具体的数据。 如果你翻阅研究资料―― 这方面的研究已经很多――关于学龄前教育计划 如何对参加过学龄前教育的人的 教育程度，薪水和技能的影响， 我们把这些影响综合起来， 估算一下接受学前教育的人有多少大的比例 会留在当地的经济圈中，没有搬走 再考虑到通过学龄前教育提高的劳动技能 促进创造了多少就业机会，你就会得出结论， 这三个不同方向的研究结果表明 在儿童早教计划中每投入一美元 会对各州居民的人均收入 增加2美金78美分 所以这是三比一的回报率 你可以得到更高的回报率 高达十六比一，如果你把社会治安的改进也考虑进来， 并且把接受过学龄前教育，但是后来 搬出去的人的收益也算在内的话。 但是现在我们把注意力放在这三美元上 因为这三个方面对于州立法者 和州政策制定者而言是最重要的 而这也是让州政府行动起来的理由。 所以对于各州的政策制定者而言 这将是一项对本州经济意义重大的举措。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:33	<br><br>
	
你可能听说过一些反对意见 或许你没有听说过因为人们不好意思说出来 就是为什么我需要付更多的税 去为别人孩子的教育投资 我得到了什么？ 这个异议的问题在于 它显示了人们的误解， 地方经济需要 每一个人的参与 特别在这里他们是相互关联的 有大量的技术外溢效应 当其他人的孩子得到了更多的技术 实际上这样会让每个人更富有 包括了那些技术没有提高的人们 举个例子，众多的研究显示 如果你查看到底是什么驱动着 都市地区的增长率 并不是低税率，低成本，低工资 是这个地区的技术。特别是 当地高校毕业生的比例 所以当你看一些都市地区 比如波士顿，明尼阿波利斯 - 圣保罗 硅谷，这些地区经济发展良好 并不是因为它们成本很低 我不知道你有没有尝试过在硅谷买房子 并不是一个低成本的投资。 它们在发展因为他们有高水准的技能 所以当我们为别人的孩子投资 并且建立那些技能，我们提高了一个区域的 总体职业增长 举另一个例子，如果我们看 是什么决定了一个人的工资 我们对此进行数据分析，是什么决定了工资 我们知道一个人的工资一部分取决于 这个人的教育 比如有没有接受过本科教育 另外一个非常有趣的事实是 我们发现就算我们在数据上 将你的教育程度对工资的影响保持不变 在都市区里其他人的教育 也会对你的工资产生影响 具体一些，如果你将你的教育保持不变 把当地的本科生比例加进去 你会发现它对你的工资有明显的改善 而完全不需要改变你的受教育程度 事实上，这个影响强烈到 当一个人获得了本科教育 它对于在大都市地区其他人 工资的溢出效应 实际大于（对你自己的）直接影响 所以如果一个人获得了本科教育，他有生之年的收入 将会增加超过700,000美金 增加都市地区的高校毕业生比例 对当地的人们都会产生影响 并且如果你把他们加起来 - 这是对每个人的小影响 但是如果你把整个都市地区的人们加起来 实际上每个人得到了薪水的提升 在都市地区增加了近百万美金 这实际上是大于选择接受高等教育的人 所带来的直接效益 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:58	<br><br>
	
现在，这是怎么回事呢？ 什么可以解释教育所带来的的巨大溢出效应？ 那么，让我们这样想 我可以成为世界上技术能力最强的人 但是如果我的公司里的其他人缺乏技术 我的雇主会难以引进 新的技术，新的生产技术 因而导致我的雇主降低生产率 他将无法支付我良好的工资 就算在我公司里的每一个人有良好的技术 如果我的供应商的工人 没有良好的技术 在国内和国际市场竞争时 我的公司竞争力会降低 同样的，竞争力较弱的公司 将会没有能力支付更高的工资 并且，特别是在高技术公司中 他们会经常从别的公司窃取理念和工人 所以很明确硅谷的生产率 不仅与公司职员的技巧有所关联 更与当地其他公司的员工相关 因此，如果我们可以为他人的孩子投资 通过高质量的学前教育和其他儿童早期教育计划 我们不仅可以帮助那些孩子 我们还会帮助都市地区的每一个人 提高总体的工资，并且能够促进都市地区的 就业增长。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:23	<br><br>
	
另一个常见的反对意见 是担心早期儿童教育计划的投资 会随着人们搬走而打水漂。 因此，可能俄亥俄州打算为自己州的 哥伦布市的孩子们 投资学前教育计划， 但是他们担心这些小朋友们将来可能 因为一些奇怪的原因，决定搬去密歇根州的安阿伯市 并且变成密歇根人。 可能密歇根在想关于投资 密歇根州安阿伯市的幼儿教育，但他们也担心 这些密歇根人会最终搬到俄亥俄州然后变成俄州人 最终他们都因为担心人们搬走而减少学前教育投入 事实上如果我们翻阅一下统计数据就会发现 美国没有人们想象的那么喜爱搬家 数据显示百分之六十以上的美国人 大部分的职业生涯花在 他们出生的州，多余百分之六十 这个比例在各州之间变化不大 这并不会受到各州经济形势的影响。 无论是萧条或是发展 随着时间的推移它并不会有很大的改变 所以现实是，如果你为孩子投资 他们会留下来 至少会有足够多的人留下来 为当地的经济发展做出贡献。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:46	<br><br>
	
好的，总结一下，有很多的研究证据表明 为高质量的学龄前教育投入，能够通过 提高成年劳动技能的方式得到补偿。 有很多的研究结果表明 这些人会留在州经济圈中 并且有很多证据表明在地区经济中 高技能劳动者数量的增加 能够提高平均工资，促进就业增长 并且我们计算得到每多投入一美元 就能够为当地经济 多贡献三美元的收益。 所以在我看来，这些研究成果是令人信服的 并且这个逻辑是有说服力的 那么有哪些障碍阻止我们去做这些事情？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:29	<br><br>
	
嗯，一个明显的障碍就是费用 我们估算了所需要投入的总额 如果各州政府都参与投资 从4岁开始普及幼儿园，全日制幼儿园 每年全国总共的花销大约是 300亿美金 那么，300亿美金是很大一笔资金 可是，如果你思考一下 美国有3亿人口 那么这笔投资平摊到每个人头上 人均只需要承担100美金 清楚了么？每人一百美金， 每一个州政府都有能力做到 这只是政府会不会去做的问题 当然，就如同我所说过的 这个支出有相对应的收益 我提过这有一个大约1比3的回报率 2.78，对于州政府来说 代表着800亿美金的额外收入 如果我们想把上百亿的美金转化成 一些有意义的事情 那么我可以告诉你，仅仅通过提高学龄前教育的质量， 不需要对K-12（大学前教育）作任何的改动 不需要对大学做任何的改造 就能够使低收入家庭背景的孩子 在成年后的总收入提高10% 并能够为来自中等收入家庭的孩子 将他们的平均薪水 提高5%。 所以这是一个投资 有非常实际的回报 能够为各州不同收入层次的人群 产生实实在在的利益 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
现在，这里有一个障碍 我觉得更严重的障碍 是学龄前教育计划回报的长期性特点 所以，我的论点是我们提高 当地劳动力的水平 将会提高地方经济 显然如果我们把4岁的孩子送到幼儿园 我们不会让这些孩子在5岁时 送去糖果店工作，对吧？至少我希望如此 所以我们在谈论一个投资 对各州经济的影响 在15到20年以内是不会体现出来的 并且美国是众所周知的 短期性社会 现在你可以对此作出的一个回应 并且我有时会在谈论时这么做 人们可以讨论关于这些计划所带来的好处 在减低特殊教育和补习教育成本 家长们关心学龄前教育 也许我们会得到一些迁移效果 让家长们寻找好的幼儿园 我觉得这是正确的 但是在某种意义上他们忽略了重点 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:11	<br><br>
	
归根结底，这是我想说的 我们为未来而投资 所以我将留给大家 这个我认为的根本问题 我想说，我是一个经济学家，但这在根本上 不是一个经济学问题，这是一个道德问题： 我们是否愿意，作为美国人 我们作为一个社会是否仍然能够 做出政治上的选择去牺牲现在 以付出更多的税作为代价 以改善长远的未来 不仅为了我们的孩子，也是为了我们的社会 作为一个国家我们是否还能够做到这一点？ 这是每一个公民 每一个选民需要问他们自己的问题 这是否是你仍然在坚持投资的， 那个你始终相信的投资理念 这就是投资的理念 为未来牺牲现在 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:15	<br><br>
	
所以我认为这些 对于儿童学龄前教育计划好处 的研究证据是极强的 但是，道德和政治上的选择 还是取决于我们，作为公民和投票者 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:34	<br><br>
	
谢谢（鼓掌） 	<br><br>

Rita Pierson, a teacher for 40 years, once heard a colleague say, "They don't pay me to like the kids." Her response: "Kids don't learn from people they don’t like.’” A rousing call to educators to believe in their students and actually connect with them on a real, human, personal level.	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years I've done the same thing. And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. We know why. But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection, relationships. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:07	<br><br>
	
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. For years, I have watched people teach. I have looked at the best and I've look at some of the worst. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:33	<br><br>
	
A colleague said to me one time, "They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it. They should learn it. Case closed." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:44	<br><br>
	
Well, I said to her, "You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
And I said to her, "Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:07	<br><br>
	
Needless to say it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship or you don't. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood, simple things like apologizing. You ever thought about that? Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
I taught a lesson once on ratios. I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it. And I got back and looked at that teacher edition. I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:44	<br><br>
	
So I came back to class the next day, and I said, "Look, guys, I need to apologize. I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson. You were so excited, we just let you go." (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient that I cried. I wondered, how am I going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be? And it was difficult. It was awfully hard. How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students, "You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
One of the students said, "Really?" (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:46	<br><br>
	
I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it, so when we walk down the hall, people will notice us, so you can't make noise. You just have to strut." And I gave them a saying to say: "I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am powerful, and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:12	<br><br>
	
And they said, "Yeah!" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
And so ― (Applause) I gave a quiz, 20 questions. A student missed 18. I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:38	<br><br>
	
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:42	<br><br>
	
I said, "Yes." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
He said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
I said, "Because you're on a roll. You got two right. You didn't miss them all." I said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you. "+2" said, "I ain't all bad." (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:11	<br><br>
	
For years I watched my mother take the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't. And I want you to just see what I've become." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former students at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone, but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
Can we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely. Will you like all your children? Of course not. And you know your toughest kids are never absent. (Laughter) Never. You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection. It's the relationships. And while you won't like them all, the key is, they can never, ever know it. So teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. We teach anyway, because that's what we do. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:59	<br><br>
	
Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha. But it is not impossible. We can do this. We're educators. We're born to make a difference. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
Thank you so much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:36	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
我这辈子 要么是在学校，要么在去学校的路上， 要么是在讨论学校里发生了什么事。 我的父母都是教育家， 我的外祖父母也都是搞教育的， 过去40年我也在从事同样的事业。 所以，很显然，过去的这些年里， 我有机会从各个角度 审视教育改革。 一些改革是有成效的。 而另一些却收效甚微。 我们知道孩子们为什么掉队辍学。 我们知道孩子们为什么学不下去。 原因无非是贫穷，低出席率， 同龄人的坏影响。我们知道为什么。 但是我们从未讨论 或者极少讨论的是 人和人之间的那种联系的价值和重要性， 这就是“关系”。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:07	<br><br>
	
James Comer (美国著名儿童精神科医师）说过 没有强有力的联系，学习就不会有显著的进步。 George Washington Carver（美国著名教育学家）说过 学习就是理解各种关系。 在座的各位都曾经被一位老师 或者一个成年人影响过。 这么多年，我都在看人们怎么教学。 我看过最好的也看过最差的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:33	<br><br>
	
一次有个同事跟我说， “我的职责不是喜欢那些孩子们。 我的职责是教书。 孩子们就该去学。 我管教课，他们管学习。就是这么个理儿。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:44	<br><br>
	
然后，我就跟她说， “你知道，孩子们可不跟他们讨厌的人学习。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
（笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:58	<br><br>
	
她接着说，“一派胡言。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
然后我对她说，“那么，亲爱的，你这一年会变得 十分漫长和痛苦。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:07	<br><br>
	
事实也果真如此。有些人认为 一个人或者天生可以建立一种关系 或者不具有这种能力。 我认为Stephen Covey（美国教育家）是对的。 他说你只需要做一些简单的事情， 比如试着首先理解他人 而不是想要被理解， 比如道歉。 你想过吗？ 跟一个孩子说你很对不起，他们都惊呆了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:32	<br><br>
	
我有一次讲比例。 我数学不是很好，但是我当时在教数学。 然后我下了课，翻看了教师用书。 我完全教错了。（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:44	<br><br>
	
所以我第二天回到班上说， “同学们，我要道歉。 我昨天的课都教错了。我非常抱歉。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:53	<br><br>
	
他们说，“没关系，Pierson老师。 你当时教得非常投入，我们就让你继续了。” （笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
我曾经教过程度非常低的班级， 学术素养差到我都哭了。 我当时就想，我怎么能在9个月之内 把这些孩子 提升到他们必须具备的水平？ 这真的很难，太艰难了。 我怎么能让一个孩子重拾自信的同时 他在学术上也有进步？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:26	<br><br>
	
有一年我有了一个非常好的主意。 我告诉我的学生们， “你们进了我的班级 因为我是最好的老师 而你们是最好的学生， 他们把我们放在一起 来给其他人做个好榜样。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
一个学生说，“真的吗？” （笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:46	<br><br>
	
我说，“当然是真的。我们要给其他班级做个榜样， 当我们走在楼道里， 因为大家都会注意到我们，我们不能吵闹。 大家要昂首阔步。” 我还给了他们一个口号：“我是个人物。 我来的时候是个人物。 我毕业的时候会变成一个更好的人物。 我很有力，很强大。 我值得在这里受教育。 我有很多事情要做，我要让人们记住我， 我要去很多地方。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:12	<br><br>
	
然后他们说：“是啊！” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:15	<br><br>
	
如果你长时间的这么说， 它就会开始变成事实。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:20	<br><br>
	
所以 － （掌声） 我做了一个小测验，20道题。 一个孩子错了18道。 我在他了卷子上写了个“＋2”和一个大的笑脸。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:38	<br><br>
	
他说，“Pierson老师，这是不及格吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:42	<br><br>
	
我说，“是的。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
他接着说，“那你为什么给我一个笑脸？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
我说，“因为你正渐入佳境。 你没有全错，还对了两个。” 我说，“我们复习这些题的时候， 难道你不会做得更好吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
他说，“是的，老师。我可以做得更好。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:00	<br><br>
	
大家看，“－18”让人感觉想死。 “＋2”意味着，“我没有那么糟。” （笑声）（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:11	<br><br>
	
好多年了，我看着我妈妈 利用课间休息时间批改作业， 下午去家访， 买梳子、刷子、花生酱和饼干 把他们放在自己的抽屉里给那些饿了的孩子们吃， 还有为那些脏孩子们准备了一条毛巾和一些肥皂。 看吧，教那些发臭的孩子是困难的一件事。 而孩子们有时也是比较“残忍”的。 所以她把这些东西都放在她的抽屉里， 然后过了很多年，在她退休以后， 我看到一些当年的孩子们回来告诉她， “您知道，Walker老师， 您改变了我的生活。 您让它有了意义。 您让我觉得我是个人物， 虽说在心底我知道我不是。 我就是想让您看看我现在成为了个什么样的人。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:57	<br><br>
	
当我妈妈两年前以92岁高龄去世的时候， 有好多好多的以前的学生来参加了她的葬礼， 我哭了，不是因为她去世了， 而是因为她留下了这些永远不会消失的 各种联系。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:12	<br><br>
	
我们真的可以有更多的关系吗？当然可以。 你会喜欢你所有的学生吗？当然不。 你也知道那些最难搞的孩子总是很难甩掉。 （笑声） 永远不会。你不会喜欢每一个人， 然而难搞的那几个的出现也是有理由的。 这就是联系，是关系。 当你不会喜欢他们每一个人的时候， 关键就是他们永远也不会知道这一点。 所以老师们变成伟大的演员， 我们得强迫自己工作， 我们得听从那些毫无道理的政策， 我们还得上课。 我们还得上课，因为这是我们的责任。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:59	<br><br>
	
教学和学习应该是让人愉快的事情。 我们的世界会变得多么的强大 如果我们的孩子都不害怕接受挑战， 不害怕思考， 都赢得了一个冠军？ 每个孩子都可以成为一个冠军， 一个成年人要永远不放弃他们， 懂得联系的强大力量， 坚信他们可以变成那个最好的自己。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
这个职业很艰巨不？当然。上帝，毫无疑问。 但是这不是不可能的。 我们可以的，因为我们是教育家。 我们天生就是重塑他人的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
非常感谢大家。 	<br><br>

Entrepreneur Elon Musk is a man with many plans. The founder of PayPal, Tesla Motors and SpaceX sits down with TED curator Chris Anderson to share details about his visionary projects, which include a mass-marketed electric car, a solar energy leasing company and a fully reusable rocket. 	<br><br>
Elon Musk	<br><br>
	
   Mar 2013 	<br><br>
Transcript	<br><br>
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:20	<br><br>
	
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university. I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity? I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production. That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century, independent of environmental concerns. In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment, given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons, we need to find some sustainable means of operating. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
CA: Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:01	<br><br>
	
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer. One is that, even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off. So if you take, say, natural gas, which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel, if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine, you'll get about 60 percent efficiency. If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car, you get about 20 percent efficiency. And the reason is, in the stationary power plant, you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more, is voluminous, and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source. So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything, even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
CA: That scale delivers efficiency. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
EM: Yes, it does. And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway, electricity generation. So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:06	<br><br>
	
CA: So we've got some video here of the Tesla being assembled, which, if we could play that first video -- So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport, and I should say that I think, actually, all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets. There's just no way around Newton's third law. The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport? And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with a really energy efficient car, so that means making it incredibly light, and so what you're seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in North America. In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack. And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size. So as a result, the energy usage is very low, and it has the most advanced battery pack, and that's what gives it the range that's competitive, so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:12	<br><br>
	
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy, but you think the math can still work out intelligently -- by combining light body, heavy battery, you can still gain spectacular efficiency. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:23	<br><br>
	
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack, and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range. And in fact, customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range. I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that, broke the world record.EM: Congratulations. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour, under normal conditions, 250 miles is a reasonable number. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
CA: Let's show that second video showing the Tesla in action on ice. Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way. What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:16	<br><br>
	
EM: In creating an electric car, the responsiveness of the car is really incredible. So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car, so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one, and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens, like the car has ESP. You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness. You can't do that with a gasoline car. I think that's really a profound difference, and people only experience that when they have a test drive. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car. Is there a road map where this becomes a mass-market vehicle? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:53	<br><br>
	
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three-step process, where version one was an expensive car at low volume, version two is medium priced and medium volume, and then version three would be low price, high volume. So we're at step two at this point. So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster. Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars. And our third generation car, which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $30,000 car. But whenever you've got really new technology, it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product. And so I think we're making progress in that direction, and I feel confident that we'll get there. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:34	<br><br>
	
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute, you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home. There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast. Do you see that coming, really, truly, or just on a few key routes? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
EM: There actually are far more charging stations than people realize, and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology, and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free, forever. And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize. We actually have California and Nevada covered, and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. covered. By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network, which charges at five times the rate of anything else. And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop, to stop time, of about six or seven. So if you drive for three hours, you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes, because that's normally what people will stop for. So if you start a trip at 9 a.m., by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat, hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:43	<br><br>
	
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour. So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes. Wait for an hour, but the good news is, you're helping save the planet, and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:56	<br><br>
	
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour. It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going. That's the natural cadence of a trip. CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow. You've been working on this solar company SolarCity. What's unusual about that? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is. We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun, and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization. What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already. If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin, and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation. The whole ecosystem is solar-powered. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:08	<br><br>
	
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have, effectively, thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space, so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar, and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas, fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:24	<br><br>
	
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:32	<br><br>
	
(Applause)CA: How? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:34	<br><br>
	
EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:38	<br><br>
	
CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers. What are you doing? EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system. Most people choose to lease. And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there. It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century. So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low, and then get the cost of the financing low, because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar. And we've made huge progress in that direction, and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is, don't pay so much up front. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front. We will install panels on your roof. You will then pay, how long is a typical lease? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:33	<br><br>
	
EM: Typical leases are 20 years, but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward. It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases. Pretty good deal. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:47	<br><br>
	
CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer. No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now. For you, the dream here then is that -- I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term? I mean, how do you, the company, benefit? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:02	<br><br>
	
EM: Well, essentially, SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say, a company or a bank. Google is one of our big partners here. And they have an expected return on that capital. With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:31	<br><br>
	
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power. You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:38	<br><br>
	
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility. I think it's a good thing, because utilities have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice. So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly, because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof. So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:05	<br><br>
	
CA: And you really picture a future where a majority of power in America, within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:15	<br><br>
	
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power, and most likely a majority, and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years. I made that bet with someone ―CA: Definition of plurality is? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:31	<br><br>
	
EM: More from solar than any other source. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:33	<br><br>
	
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:37	<br><br>
	
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:40	<br><br>
	
CA: Just between us. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:44	<br><br>
	
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago, so in roughly 18 years, I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:53	<br><br>
	
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet. You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal. You decided to build a space company. Why on Earth would someone do that? (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:08	<br><br>
	
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true. People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry?" Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline. And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one. And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:28	<br><br>
	
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:33	<br><br>
	
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out. We came very close to failure, but we managed to get through that point in 2008. The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology, and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization, which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:58	<br><br>
	
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization? So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age? You've dreamed of Mars and beyond? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid, but I didn't think I'd be involved in this. It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one? And I really think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets, and I think that's really exciting, compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:40	<br><br>
	
CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it. How on Earth have you done that? NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
EM: Well, we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe, the engines, the electronics and the launch operation. There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but -- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right? You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:16	<br><br>
	
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:21	<br><br>
	
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments, the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
CA: That's really, really interesting. But the big innovation is still ahead, and you're working on it now. Tell us about this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:37	<br><br>
	
EM: Right, so the big innovation― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:38	<br><br>
	
CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable. All rockets that fly today are fully expendable. The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket, but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time, and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight. So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight. Obviously that doesn't work very well for ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:08	<br><br>
	
CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:12	<br><br>
	
EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:22	<br><br>
	
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause) And so what a lot of people don't realize is, the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small. It's much like on a jet. So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket. So it's possible to achieve, let's say, roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket. That's why it's so important. Every mode of transport that we use, whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses, is reusable, but not rockets. So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:00	<br><br>
	
CA: You asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:12	<br><br>
	
CA: Definitely more expensive. So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology, and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take, at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale. You'd like to see a colony on Mars. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:28	<br><br>
	
EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination of companies and governments, needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi-planetary, of establishing a base on another planet, on Mars -- being the only realistic option -- and then building that base up until we're a true multi-planet species. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:48	<br><br>
	
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable," how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw. How's it going? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:56	<br><br>
	
EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project, where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight, the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky. And we've had some good tests. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:12	<br><br>
	
CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah. So that's just to give a sense of scale. We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:21	<br><br>
	
CA: All right, let's see that video then, because this is actually amazing when you think about it. You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then -- 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:30	<br><br>
	
EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building. (Rocket launch) So now it's hovering at about 40 meters, and it's constantly adjusting the angle, the pitch and yaw of the main engine, and maintaining roll with coal gas thrusters. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:05	<br><br>
	
CA: How cool is that? (Applause) Elon, how have you done this? These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity, Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different, they're such ambitious projects at scale. How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way? What is it about you? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:33	<br><br>
	
EM: I don't know, actually. I don't have a good answer for you. I work a lot. I mean, a lot. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:44	<br><br>
	
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:46	<br><br>
	
CA: My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design, technology and business, so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business, into one package, synthesize it in a way that very few people can and -- and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks. You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times. I mean, almost no one can do that. Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce? Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you? It is truly amazing what you've done. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:30	<br><br>
	
EM: Well, thanks. Thank you. Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive. So I think that's an important thing to do, and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback, and solicit it, particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:35	<br><br>
	
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics. Learn from this man. Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:43	<br><br>
	
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool. Look at that. (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:49	<br><br>
	
Just take a bow. That was fantastic. Thank you so much. 	<br><br>

克里斯特.安德森: 埃隆，怎样的疯狂梦想 会让你想去尝试 从事汽车行业然后建造出全电动汽车的呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:20	<br><br>
	
埃隆.马斯克: 嗯，那是我还在上大学的时候。 我当时在想，有哪些问题最可能 影响世界或人类的未来？ 我觉得拥有可持续的交通方式 和可持续的能源生产是极其重要的。 那类有关于可持续能源的问题 是我们这个世纪需要解决的最大问题， 如果不考虑环境问题的话。 实际上，即便CO2的产生对于环境是有好处的， 假设我们将要耗尽碳氢化合物， 我们仍然需要找到一个可持续的运作方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:51	<br><br>
	
克里斯特.安德森：大多数美国的电力都来自于 燃烧化石燃料。 那么一个使用这一类电能的电动汽车又有什么用呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:01	<br><br>
	
埃隆.马斯克：对。这个答案有两个要素。 一个是，即便你采用同一类燃料 然后在发电厂发电 并用它来给汽车充电，这仍会好很多。 因为如果你用，比如说，天然气吧， 这是最常见的碳氢化合物燃料， 如果你在一部现代 通用电气天然气涡轮中燃烧它， 你会得到60%的燃烧效率。 如果你把它用在一个使用内燃机的汽车中， 那你的使用效率只有大约20%。 这个道理是这样的，在固定的发电站， 你可以支付得起更重的东西， 非常大量的， 然后你可以利用余热 发动蒸汽涡轮机接着进行二次发电。 一个二次能源。 实际上，即使你将传输损耗等等一切也考虑进去， 就算使用同类的燃料，给一辆车充电至少要两倍优于 你之后在发电站燃烧这些燃料。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:48	<br><br>
	
克里斯特.安德森: 这个规模能够带来效率。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:50	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克: 是的，的确如此。 然后另外一点是，我们不论如何必须要有可以持续 生产能源的方法，发电。 所以假设我们必须解决可持续发电的问题， 那我们就理所当然要用电动车 作为交通方式。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:06	<br><br>
	
克里斯.安德森：我们这里有一些 正在组装 ‘特斯拉‘ （Telsa 电力车）的短片， 嗯，如果我们播放第一个视频的话 C 那这辆车的组装过程有什么创新之处呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:18	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克: 当然。那么为了加快电力交通到来的步伐， 我要说的是我个人认为，实际上， 所有的交通方式都会变成全电力驱动的， 讽刺的是，除了火箭以外。 因为实在是没有办法可以绕开牛顿第三定律。 问题是怎么加快 电动交通到来的步伐呢？ 为了让小车更快的全电动化，人们要发明出 一种真正节能的车， 也就是说这个车要难以置信地轻巧， 你现在所看到的 是在北美制造的 唯一一个全铝车身和车底盘。 其实，我们用了非常多的火箭设计技术 来减轻车身重量，即便还装有一个很大的电池组。 然后它的阻力系数是 相同大小车型当中最低的。 所以，它的能耗也非常低的， 它的电池组也是最先进的， 正因为如此它的行驶里程非常有竞争力， 因此它拥有行驶大概250英里的能力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:12	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森: 我是说，那些电池组特别的重， 但是你认为通过数学计算还是能够巧妙解决问题的 C 就是通过组合轻的车身、重的电池， 最后你还是可以得到惊人的效率。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:23	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：正是这样。车的其他部分必须要很轻 才能抵消电池组的质量， 然后你必须要有很低的阻力系数这样才能达到良好的里程数。 事实上，S型号的客户 都在相互竞争 以获取可能的最高行程范围。 我知道有人近期已经实现了一次充电就可以跑420英里的效果。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:41	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：布鲁诺.波登, 在座的这位，他做到了， 他打破了世界纪录。埃隆・马斯克：恭喜。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:47	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森: 那是个好消息。坏消息是 为了达成目的，他必须要以每小时18英里的恒速行驶 然后被警察拦下来。（笑） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:55	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：我是说，你当然可以开到 C 如果你开到每小时65英里， 在正常情况下， 250英里是一个合理的数据。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:06	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：我们播一下第二个视频， 是 Tesla 在雪地上运行的视频。 绝对不是挖苦纽约时报，这个，顺便说一下。 关于驾驶体验最令人惊喜的 是什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:16	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克: 创造一辆电动车的时候， 这个车的反应能力是非常难以置信的。 所以我们真想让人们觉得 他们和车的思想已经融汇到一起了， 所以你会觉得你和车已经合二为一了， 所以你要转弯和要加速的时候，它马上就会做到， 好像这个车有ESP（电子稳定程序）。 电动车能够做到这点是因为它有很好的反映能力。 而汽油车是不行的。 我觉得这真的是个很大的差别， 而人们只有在试驾的时候会感受到这个差别。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:44	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：我想说，这个是个很漂亮的车不过它也很贵。 你有什么样的计划来让它变成 一种畅销车吗？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:53	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：是的。 实现Tesla 的目标需要 有三个步骤， 首先是生产少批量昂贵的车型， 然后第二是中批量的中等价位的车型， 最后是低价高批量的车型。 我们现在正处在第二步骤。 我们生产了10万美金的跑车，也就是 Roadster。 然后我们还有S型号，大概以5万美金起价。 而我们的第三代车型，应该会在 大约3到4年发布出来， 定价是3万美金。 不过无论什么时候，你拥有真正的新技术， 大概都要设计出3种主要车型 最有才能让它成为真正的畅销产品。 最后我觉得我们正在朝这个方向一直在进步， 我也觉得有信心能够实现目标。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:34	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：我想说，目前，如果通勤距离短的话， 你就可以开这个车，你可以回家，然后在家充电。 目前全国范围内尚未普及一个庞大的快速充电站网络。 你是否预见到这种网络的到来，真的，实实在在地预计到了， 还是只是说在一些主要的道路上普及充电站？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:49	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：实际上充电站的数量 要比人们知道的多得多， 而在 Tesla 我们研发了一种 叫做“超级充电”的技术， 而我们可以提供这个服务，如果你买了 S 型号， 而且是免费的，永久的。 然后这可能是很多人都没有意识到的事情。 我们其实已经在加州和内华达州都建设了网络， 然后在东部滨海的 波士顿到华盛顿特区也都覆盖了。 到今年底，你就可以 从洛杉矶开车到纽约了， 只需要使用超级充电网络就行， 它的充电速率是其他地方的五倍。 然后关键的一点是要有一个开车与停车的比率， 停车的时间，这个比率大概是6到7这样。 所以如果你开了3个小时， 你会想要停20到30分钟， 因为通常人们也会停这么久。 所以如果你早上9点开始开车， 你中午也会想要停下来去吃午餐， 去上洗手间，喝咖啡，然后再继续开。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:43	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：那你给消费者的提议是，为了充满电，大概需要一个小时的时间。 这是正常情况 C 不要期待10分钟就可以冲完。 要等一个小时，不过好消息是， 你为拯救地球除了一份力， 然后顺便说下，电是免费的。你不用花钱。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:56	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：其实，我们想要做到的是， 让人们只等20到30分钟，而不是一小时。 实际上开大概160、170英里 然后停半个小时 再走会更好。 这是一个比较自然的节奏。 克里斯・安德森：好。那么这只是你在能源方面的一个优势。 你其实还经营了一家太阳能公司“太阳城”。 那又有什么特别之处呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：嗯，我刚刚说了， 我们耗电的同时必须要 能可持续的发电， 所以我相当确信首要的发电方式 会是太阳能。 我是说，它是一种间接的融合发电，是这样的。 我们在天上有一个巨大的融合发电器叫做太阳， 而我们只需开采其中的一点点能源 来为人类文明服务。 大部分人都知道却又没有意识到的是 这个世界基本上早已全都依靠着太阳能发电了。 如果我们没有太阳，我们就会在3凯氏度下 冻成了一个冰球， 而太阳它为整个降水系统提供了电力。 整个生态系统都是靠太阳能发电的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:08	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：但是在一加仑的汽油中，有， 实际上，是在一个很小的空间当中 压缩了上千年积累而来的太阳能， 所以这个数据说明利用太阳能是有难度的， 而且远远不能和，比如说，和天然气相提并论， 水力压裂开采的天然气。这样的话你怎么做生意呢？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:24	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克:嗯，其实，我还是很确信太阳能 会压倒一切，也容易开采，也比天然气更胜一筹。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:32	<br><br>
	
（掌声）克里斯・安德森：怎么说？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:34	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：着肯定的，其实。如果它不是这样的话，那我们麻烦可就大了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:38	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：不过你没有把太阳能电池板卖给顾客啊。 你们都经营些什么呢？ 埃隆・马斯克：不是的，我们其实有卖的。你可以买一个太阳能系统 或者租一个。 大部分人都选择租。 而太阳能有个优势是 它没有任何的原料或者经营成本， 所以一旦装好了，就都一切就绪了。 可以用几十年。甚至可能可以用100年。 所以，关键的一部是把降低 第一次的安装费用， 然后减少融资成本， 因为那 ―― 那些是推涨太阳能价格的两个因素。 而我们朝这个方向已经取得了很大的进步， 所以我才这么确信我们可以把天然气比下去。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：那你目前给消费者的提议是， 先不要花那么多钱。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:24	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：零。克里斯・安德森：先不要花钱。 我们会在你的屋顶上安装太阳能板。 你之后再付款，租用期一般是多久？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:33	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：一般租用期是20年， 不过我们的价值定位是这样的，你也差不多暗示了，应该是说的蛮直白的了。 不用花钱，然后你的物业费也会降低。 非常合算的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:47	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：所以这看起来好像是消费者成了赢家。 没有风险，你花的钱会比现在少。 对你来说，理想是―― 我是说，是谁长期享用有这些太阳能发电呢？ 我是说，你怎么，你的公司，怎么获利？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:02	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：其实吧， 太阳城公司从很多地方筹集到了大笔资金， 比如说，其他公司或者银行。 谷歌是我们的大合作伙伴。 而他们的投资也会有回报。 有了资金，太阳城可以购买太阳能 然后在安装在屋顶上， 然后每月向住户或者企业收取租金，这比物业费要低。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:31	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：但是你自己要从经营太阳能当中长期获取商业利益。 你差不多是在建立一种新型的分散式发电。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:38	<br><br>
	
正是如此。这就相当于 一个大规模的分散式发电。 我觉得这很好，因为发电 长期都是一个垄断的行业，然后人们没有多少选择。 所以实际上这是 与垄断的第一次抗衡， 因为发电厂一直是唯一一个 拥有这些输电线路的人，不过现在你可以在你的屋顶上发电。 所以我觉得这对于 各个家庭和企业实际上都是非常有利的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:05	<br><br>
	
那你真的能够想象的出 在美国的未来大部分的电力， 也就是在一二十年内，或者在你有生之年力，能够是由太阳能创造的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:15	<br><br>
	
我极其确信太阳能至少会成为一种多数能源， 而且非常可能成为一种主要方式， 而我也预言不到20年就会实现。 我也和某人打了个赌 ― 克里斯・安德森：“多数”的定义什么？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:31	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：太阳能发的电比其他的要多。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:33	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：哦。那你和谁打赌了？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:37	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：一个无名朋友。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:40	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：就是我们两个啦。（笑） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:44	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：我打了这个赌，应该是两三年前的时候， 我说大概18年后， 我认为我们能够从太阳那里获取比其他能源更多的电力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:53	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森:那好，我们回头继续聊聊另外一个 你和自己打的赌，我猜，是一个疯狂的赌注。 你从PayPal上面赚了些钱。 你又决定要建立一个航天公司。 到底为什么有人会那么做呢？ （笑） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:08	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克: 经常有人问我这个问题，确实如此。 人们都说“你有没听过一个笑话，是一个人 在航空领域挣了点小钱？” 显然，“他一开始投入了大笔资金”是其中的幽默点。 然后我会和他们说，恩，我想要找出一个 把大笔财富转化成小笔财富的最快方式。 然后他们都看着我说，“他是认真的吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:28	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森: 奇怪的是，你确实是认真的。之后怎么样？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:33	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：很侥幸了。本来是几乎不可能成功的事。 我们几乎要失败了， 不过还是熬过了2008年的难关。 我们SpaceX的目标是推进火箭技术， 特别是要解决一个问题， 我认为这个问题 对于人类进入太空文明来说是至关重要的， 也就是要拥有一个能够迅速且完全可重复使用的火箭。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:58	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：人类会成为太空文明吗？ 这是是你的梦想，甚至是，你小时候的梦想？ 你曾梦想过去火星甚至更远的地方？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:08	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：我在小的时候确实造过火箭， 不过我不觉得我会参与其中。 更多的只是这样一个角度， 就是我们需要创造哪些东西来使 我们的未来变得令人激动而且鼓舞人心？ 而我真的觉得有一个基本的区别， 如果你想象下未来， 在太空文明中的人类， 他们会出去探索星球，不同的星球， 而我觉得那真是激动人心， 比起我们永远的困在地球上 直至灭绝来说，确实如此。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:40	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：那你还是把火箭的建造成本降低了 75%，按照你的计算方式。 你到底怎么做到的？ NASA（美国宇航局）为此花了数年的时间。你却是怎么成功的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:51	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：嗯，我们在机身技术上有了巨大的进步， 同时还有引擎， 电子设备还有发射操作技术。 我们还有一串的 创新技术， 在这里讲这些可能有点困难，但是 ―― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:10	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：尤其是因为你还是可以将其申请专利的，对吗？ 你还没有申请。这真的令我感兴趣。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:16	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：没，我们不申请。克里斯・安德森：你没申请是因为你觉得 申请比不申请更危险。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:21	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：既然我们的首要竞争对手是国家政府， 那专利的执行性就不可靠了。（笑） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:28	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：那真是，真是太有意思了。 不过将来还有一个大创新， 你目前正在着手。和我们说一下吧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:37	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克: 对,这个大创新制作 ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:38	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：其实，我们播放一下视频然后你可以一边跟我们说，视频上都是些什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:43	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：好。那关于这个火箭呢， 它们目前都不能重复使用。 如今所有的火箭都完全是不可重复利用的。 航天飞机的目的就是为了使火箭可以重复利用， 但是即便是航天飞机的主油箱每次都要用完就扔， 而可以重复使用的零部件 要用1万人的队伍花9个月的时间来更新。 所以一个航天飞机每次飞行的最后成本都高达10亿美元。 显然这不是很理想 ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:08	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：然后这是什么？我们看到有什么降落了？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:12	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：对。所以能让火箭的底座 回到陆地上， 能够回到发射基地然后准备在几个小时内做好下一次发射的准备，这是很重要的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:22	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：哇。可循环利用的火箭。埃隆・马斯克：对。（掌声） 还有一个很多人没意识到的是， 燃料的成本，也就是推进物的成本，很低。 和喷气式飞机的差不多。 所以推进物的成本大约 是火箭成本的0.3%。 所以我们可以让，比如说， 太空行程的成本改善大约100倍， 只要你能够做到重复利用火箭。 所以说为什么这很重要。 我们用的每一种交通， 飞机、火车、汽车、单车、马 都是可重复利用的，唯独火箭不是。 所以我们必须要解决这个问题从而进入太空文明。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:00	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：你之前问我一个问题， 如果你必须在用完轮船后把它烧毁， 那么邮轮这种出行方式还会有多受欢迎。埃隆・马斯克：一些邮轮旅游显然会出现大问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:12	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：肯定会更贵。 所以那很有可能是绝对性的破坏技术， 而且，我猜，它为你的梦想铺平了道路， 从某点上来说，就是那个让人类大规模的移居火星的梦想。 你想看到人们在火星上殖民。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:28	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：对，正是这样。SpaceX，或者其他一些 公司和政府的合作，需要 在多星球生活圈的道路上更进一步， 在另外一个星球建立基地， 就是火星 ― 唯一个实际的选择，― 然后接着扩建基地 直至我们成为真正能在多星球上生存的物种。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:48	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：那么“让它循环利用”的行动 进展如何？我们刚刚就看到了一个模拟视频。 现在如何了？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:56	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：实际上我们，我们近期在一个叫做 “蚱蜢测验计划”中取得了不错的进展， 我们在这个计划当中测试了火箭垂直降落的这一个部分， 这个最后的部分相当复杂。 那我们在测验中取得了不错的成绩。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:12	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：我们能看下吗？埃隆・马斯克：可以。 那只是给你一个规模上的感受。 我们把一个牛仔打扮成约翰尼.卡什 然后把这个人体模型拴在火箭上。（笑） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:21	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：好，我们看一下这个视频， 因为实际上你想一下就会觉得它其实很令人惊异。 你从来没见过。一个火箭发射后然后―― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:30	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：是啊，那个火箭大约是 一座12层建筑的大小。 （火箭发射） 那现在在空中40米处停悬， 然后一直在调整 角度，主发动机的俯仰和偏航， 然后用煤气推进器保持滚动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:05	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：这不是很酷吗？（掌声） 埃隆，你怎么做到的？ 这些计划都――Paypal，太阳城， Tesla，SpaceX，他们都彼此那么不同， 都是大规模的宏伟计划。 怎么会有人可以 用这样的方式创新？ 你到底如何做到的？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:33	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：我也不知道，其实。 我没法很好的回答你。 我做了很多工作。真的，很多。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:44	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：恩，我有个理论。埃隆・马斯克：好。不错。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:46	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：我的理论就是你 有一种能力，可以让你在设计的层面系统地思考， 汇聚了设计、科技和商业， 所以如果TED是TBD，Design（设计）、Technology（科技）和 Business （商业）， 把他们打包起来， 以一种人们很少能够做到的方式融合起来然后 ―― 然后关键的是――你对这个 拼接的组合非常的有信心，甚至会去冒疯狂的风险。 你赌上了你的财富，而且你好像还赌了好几次。 我想说，基本没别人会这么做了。 是不是――我们能不能分享一下秘诀？ 我们能否将它放进我们的教育系统中？人们可以向你学习到什么吗？ 你所做的真的太令人惊叹了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:30	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：嗯，谢谢。谢谢。 呃，我真的觉得我们有一个非常好的思考框架。 就是物理。你知道，它是推理的第一原理。 我大体上认为有――我想说的是， 把一切都归结于事物的基本本质 然后从此处开始推理， 这不同于类比推理。 我们生活当中， 我们都是用类比推理， 实际上就是说我们要照搬别人的做法然后稍加改动。 你必须这样做。 否则，从心理层面看，你这一天就过不去了。 不过当你想要做一件新的事情， 你必须按物理原则办事。 物理正是一种 用反直觉的方式来发现新事物的方法，就像量子力学。 它就非常反直觉。 所以我觉得这是非常重要的事情， 然后也要非常注重负面的反馈， 寻求反馈，特别是从朋友那里。 这可能听起来像个很简单的建议， 但是很少人这么做， 这是非常有帮助的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:35	<br><br>
	
克里斯・安德森：男孩们女孩们，要学物理啊。 向这个人学习。 埃隆・马斯克，我希望我们可以聊一整天，不过谢谢你来到TED。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:43	<br><br>
	
埃隆・马斯克：谢谢。克里斯・安德森：真是太厉害了。真的，真的很酷。 看看。（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
20:49	<br><br>
	
鞠个躬。太奇妙了。 非常感谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">The Internet could crash. We need a Plan B</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In the 1970s and 1980s, a generous spirit suffused the Internet, whose users were few and far between. But today, the net is ubiquitous, connecting billions of people, machines and essential pieces of infrastructure ― leaving us vulnerable to cyber-attack or meltdown. Internet pioneer Danny Hillis argues that the Internet wasn't designed for this kind of scale, and sounds a clarion call for us to develop a Plan B: a parallel system to fall back on if ― or when ― the Internet crashes. 	<br><br>

So, this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982. (Laughter) Actually, it's deceptively large. There's actually only about 20 people on each page, because we have the name, address and telephone number of every single person. And, in fact, everybody's listed twice, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. Obviously a very small community. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. I knew them both. We didn't all know each other, but we all kind of trusted each other, and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network, and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community, let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. Now, it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com. So I picked think.com, but then I thought, you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there. Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days, and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network, but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol, and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it, were fundamentally "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need." And so, if you had some extra bandwidth, you'd deliver a message for someone. If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you. You'd kind of depend on people to do that, and that was the building block. It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet. It was incredibly successful. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this. My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick. But, of course, you couldn't do it, because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses, and even if we did know their names, I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name, address and telephone number published to everyone. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:10	<br><br>
	
So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days, and so we dealt with that by making walled communities, secure subnetworks, VPNs, little things that aren't really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks, but we're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust. And that means that it's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen, or certain kinds of deliberate attacks, but even the mistakes can be bad. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
So, for instance, in all of Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did because of the way that the protocols work. Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is, you may remember a couple of years ago, all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it. Now, you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet, and in some sense it doesn't. I'll come back to that later. But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet, and the router card was down. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:34	<br><br>
	
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen. Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April. All of a sudden, a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet, including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations, started getting re-routed through China. So for a few hours, it all passed through China. Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake, and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work, but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to, and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:18	<br><br>
	
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days, they're not going to do it with tanks. That will not succeed. What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility. Nobody has claimed credit for that. There was basically a factory of industrial machines. It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet. It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet, but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there, or something like that, and software got in there that causes the centrifuges, in that case, to actually destroy themselves. Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant. And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers, about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:13	<br><br>
	
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet, and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium. And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile. So actually, in the early days, back when it was the ARPANET, there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it. And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it. So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy, who would send it back in time and get it there super early, so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node, and of course that clogged everything up. Everything started breaking. The interesting thing was, though, that the sysadmins were able to fix it, but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off. Now, of course you couldn't do that today. I mean, everything off, it's like the service call you get from the cable company, except for the whole world. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:40	<br><br>
	
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today. One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now, and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things, like when you take off from LAX, you're really not thinking you're using the Internet. When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet. What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems are beginning to use the Internet. Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet, but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions, for administrative functions, and so if you take something like the cell phone system, which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part, Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions, and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well, they're cheap, they're repeated, and so on. So all of our systems, more and more, are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology. And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:52	<br><br>
	
So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it, but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it, and it's gotten a very, very different scale than it was designed for. And in fact, nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now. It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have. And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that. They have an informed opinion, but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on. So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess. Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago. It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:00	<br><br>
	
And the problem with it is, I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system, where we take a system that's basically built on trust, was basically built for a smaller-scale system, and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate. And so right now, I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the Internet would be, and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year, and worse next year, and so on. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:35	<br><br>
	
But so what we need is a plan B. There is no plan B right now. There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet, made out of completely different sets of building blocks. So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet, but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet, or the hospitals have to order fuel oil. This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project. It's actually relatively simple to do, technically, because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground, existing wireless infrastructure. It's basically a matter of deciding to do it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:16	<br><br>
	
But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it, and that's the problem that we have right now. So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
So I think that, if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet, and how vulnerable it is, we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist, and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it, I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built. It's not that hard a problem. It could definitely be done by people in this room. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:02	<br><br>
	
And so I think that this is actually, of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference, this is probably one of the very easiest to fix. So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:15	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>

呃，我手里的这本书 是1982年所有拥有电邮地址的人的通讯录。 （笑声） 它看起来很大，其实不然。 这本通讯录实际上每页只记录了大约20个人， 因为我们每一个人都有自己的姓名， 地址和电话号码。 同时，每个人的信息都出现了两次， 因为有两种排序方式：根据名字和根据电子邮件地址。 当然这是个很小的社区。 当时，互联网上只有另外两个名字也叫丹尼的人。 他们两个我都认识。 虽然我们彼此之间并不全都认识， 但是我们互相信任， 这种基本的信任感 充满了整个网络， 并且大家可以感觉到 我们能彼此信赖的去完成一些事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:05	<br><br>
	
因此，为了让你们能体会到当时该社区的那种信任程度， 下面让我来告诉你在早期 是如何注册域名的。 现在，假象我我刚注册了 我的第三个互联网域名。 于是我可以起任何我想要的名字作为域名， 除了"bbn.com"和"symbolics.com"之外。 于是我注册了"think.com"，但是我又想， 除此之外还有很多有趣的域名。 也许我应该多注册几个以备不时之需。 我又想：“呐，这样不太好吧。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:39	<br><br>
	
(笑声) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:45	<br><br>
	
在那时，这种只取己需的态度 在网络上几乎人人拥有， 而且事实上，不仅仅是使用网络的人有这种态度 这种态度也植根于 互联网协议自身。 所以，I.P.,或者互联网协议的基本思想， 以及路由算法用到的工作方式， 从根本上来说是“各尽其能 各取所需。” 因此，如果你有额外的带宽， 你代别人发送信息。 如果他们也有额外的带宽，他们也可以代你发送信息。 你将会逐渐依靠于他人才能来完成信息的交换， 而这就是构建的基石。 有趣的是，虽然这样一个共产原则 居然是国防部在冷战期间开发的一个 系统的核心， 而很明显它的效果非常好， 我们已经目睹了互联网发生的一切。 毋庸置疑，非常的成功。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
实际上，互联网如此成功，以至于如今你不可能 出版这样一本通讯录了。 我粗略计算，如果这本书出版出来将会有25英尺厚。 当然，你也做不不出来， 因为我们不知道所有上网人的名字， 或者电子邮件地址， 即使我们知道他们的名字， 我确信他们也不愿意将他们的名字， 地址和电话号码公诸于众。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:10	<br><br>
	
事实是当今在互联网上有很多坏人， 我们的应对方法是建立一个 封闭的社区， 安全子网，虚拟私有网， 以及类似于因特网但又不是因特网的工具， 虽然他们拥有相同的构建原理， 但是我们构建他们并不完全照搬因特网的构建基本原理， 而是基于与因特网一样，对信任的假设。 这意味着这种网络易受到 某种可能发生的某种错误的干扰 以及受某种蓄意的攻击， 但是即使是错误，也会很麻烦。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:45	<br><br>
	
例如， 最近在亚洲的所有地区， 有一小段时间不能访问YouTube 是因为巴基斯坦在其内部网络审查YouTube的方法上 犯了一些错误。 他们无意于在亚洲墙掉Youtube，但由于的协议工作方式， 他们确实短时间内阻断了Youtube。 另一个可能会影响很多在座听众的例子是， 你可能还记得在数年前， 密西西比州西部的所有飞机停航了， 是因为盐湖城的一个路由卡 出现了问题。 你当然不会认为 飞机系统依赖于因特网， 在某种意义上它确实不依靠因特网。 稍后我会再谈到这一点。 事实是人们不能起飞， 是因为互联网出了某种问题， 路由卡宕机了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:34	<br><br>
	
许多类似的事情在不断的发生。 去年四月发生了一件有趣的事情。 突然， 整个互联网上相当大量的流量， 包括美国军方网络的很多流量， 开始通过中国改道发送。 在数小时内，这些流量经由中国。 中国电信声称这并非有意为之， 很可能确实如此，事实就是这样 但毫无疑问的是如果有人 蓄意这样做，那也很容易。 这表明在面临错误时，系统是如何脆弱。 顾设想面临蓄意攻击时，系统该是多么脆弱啊。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:18	<br><br>
	
现在，如果有人蓄意攻击美国 或者西方社会， 他们不会采用坦克。 当然这样做也不会成功。 他们可能采取的行动 会非常类似于针对伊朗核设施 发动的攻击。 没有人会声称对此负责。 基本上那只是一个制造工业机器的工厂。 它自己不会认为自己在互联网上。 它自己认为自己是与互联网隔离的， 但是有可能有人 偷偷带进了一个U盘或类似U盘的东西， 和软件潜入工厂，让工厂里的离心分离机 自毁。 由于当今有类似的软件可以摧毁一家炼油厂， 制药厂，或者半导体工厂。 所以人们不免有许多--我相信你们在报纸上也看了很多， 有关网络攻击 和对网络攻击的防御的担忧. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:13	<br><br>
	
但事实上，人们主要着眼于 联网电脑的保护， 反而极少关注 作为通讯介质的互联网本身的保护。 我认为我们需要更多的 关注这一点，因为互联网是脆弱的。 事实上，在早期， 在阿帕网年代， 事实上确实有发生过一次整个网络完全宕掉了一段时间的情况， 原因是某个单一信息处理器 有问题。 互联网的工作方式是 路由器交换的讯息从根本上来说 是关于它们如何将信息发送到指定的位置， 因为一张坏卡，这个处理器 认为它实际上可以在负时间内 将信息送到某地方。 换句话说，它声称它可以在接收一条信息之前就发送。 因此，显然，最快的接收任何地方信息的方式就是 将信息发给这个处理器， 他会及时地送回并且超早地送达， 因此互联网上的每条信息 开始通过这个节点交换， 理所当然的会堵塞。 一切开始中断。 尽管如此，有趣的是， 系统管理员可以解决这个问题， 但是基本上他们必须关掉所有的互联网。 当然现在不可能这样做。 我的意思是，关掉一切，有点像 整个世界你只接得到 有线电视公司打给你的服务电话。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:40	<br><br>
	
现在，事实上，由于一些原因，他们不能做到这一点。 其中一个原因是他们的电话 采用IP协议，并且使用像Skype之类的 通过互联网通讯的工具， 事实上，我们越来越依赖于它， 去做越来越多不同的事情， 比如，当你当你从洛杉矶起飞， 你不会认为你在使用互联网。 当你加气时，你也不会认为你在使用互联网。 但是，渐渐发生的却是这些系统 开始逐渐使用互联网。 大部分还不是基于互联网， 但是他们开始使用互联网类提供服务功能， 和行政功能， 因此如果你需要类似于电话系统的东西， 它现在大部分仍然相对的独立于互联网， 互联网势力正在开始以一些控制和行政 功能的方式侵入电话系统， 而且基于同样构建的网络手机系统显得是那么的诱人， 因为他们运作良好，廉价， 他们可以重复，等等。 因此我们的系统，越来越多地， 开始使用相同的技术 并且开始依赖于这种技术。 因此即使是现代装备火箭的船舰 如今也事实上使用互联网协议 与其他的舰船联系。 这太疯狂了。互联网最初的设计宗旨肯定不是这个。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:52	<br><br>
	
所以我们建造了这个系统， 我们虽然了解这个系统的所有部分， 但是我们以一种不同于预期的非常不同的方式在使用它， 而它的规模也与设计 大相径庭。 事实上，没有人真正完全了解 所有这些如今使用的东西。 它正在成为像财政系统这么大的一个应急系统， 在这个应急系统中我们已经设计好所有部分， 但没有人真正了解 它的运作方式，它的所有细节， 以及它能有怎样的应急行为。 所以，如果你听到一个专家谈论互联网， 提起它能做这个，它这样做或者它将会做什么， 你应该持怀疑态度， 就像你怀疑一个经济学家对经济的评论 怀疑一个气象员的天气播报，等类似的行为一样。 虽然这些专家们见多识广， 但是互联网发展得如此迅速，以至于专家们 也不能确切地知道将会发生了什么事。 所以如果你看到一些互联网宏图， 它们只是某人的猜测而已。 没人真正知道互联网如今是什么， 因为它每个小时都不一样， 它在不断的在变化，不断的在重新配置。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:00	<br><br>
	
而问题在于， 我认为，我们正在将我们自己置于类似于 金融风暴那样的灾难之上， 在金融系统中我们采用了一个基于信任建立的系统， 该系统只是一个小规模的系统， 我们已经扩展了该系统，且超出了 该系统运作的极限。 因此，我认为， 我们不知道互联网 收到一个有效的拒绝服务攻击的 后果将会如何， 而无论如何变化，它将会变得更糟，再过一年 会更加糟糕，年复一年，越来越糟。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:35	<br><br>
	
于是就是我们需要一个B计划。 但是目前没有B计划。 不存在一个我们谨慎的让它独立于互联网之外的 明确的备份系统， 该系统是由完全不同的构件所建立。 因此我们需要的系统并不一定 必须有因特网的功能， 但是，即使在没有互联网的情况下， 警察部门必须能够呼叫消防部门， 或者医院可以订购燃油。 这不是那种花费数十亿美金的政府项目。 从技术上讲，这个项目非常简单， 因为他可以利用地下已有的无线基础架构- 光纤。 这不过是个简单的决定。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:16	<br><br>
	
但是直到人民意识到真正的需要， 才会决定去做， 这就是现在的问题所在。 因此大量的人， 大量的专家们多年来一直在静静地争论 我们应该有这么一套独立的系统， 但很难让人们在互联网运行良好时， 去关注B计划。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
因此我认为，如果人们认识到 我们逐渐有多么地依赖互联网， 互联网是多么的脆弱， 我们能够着眼于 希望这样的系统存在， 并且我认为，如果足够多的人说：”是的，我想使用它， 我愿意有这样一个系统”，它就会得以建立。 这不是一个难题， 甚至可以由在座的某位完成。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:02	<br><br>
	
因此我认为，实际上， 在会议上将会听到的所有问题， 极有可能存在一种非常容易的解决方案。 我很高兴有机会告诉你们这一点。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:15	<br><br>
	
非常感谢。 	<br><br>

Don't make people pay for music, says Amanda Palmer: Let them. In a passionate talk that begins in her days as a street performer (drop a dollar in the hat for the Eight-Foot Bride!), she examines the new relationship between artist and fan. 	<br><br>

(Breathes in, breathes out) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
So I didn't always make my living from music. For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job. I was a self-employed living statue called the 8-Foot Bride, and I love telling people l did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life? Hello. I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:26	<br><br>
	
So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. And my eyes would say, "Thank you. I see you." And their eyes would say, "Nobody ever sees me. Thank you." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
And I would get harassed sometimes. People would yell at me from their passing cars. "Get a job!" And I'd be, like, "This is my job." But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful. I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday. It was consistent. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls. This was me on piano, a genius drummer. I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it. So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:31	<br><br>
	
And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London. People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle. Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig. This is a library in Auckland. On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris from Newport Beach, who says hello. I once tweeted, where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot? And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
And I love this kind of random closeness, which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing. In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home, and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. And I lay there thinking, these people have so little. Is this fair? And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, "Your music has helped my daughter so much. Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful." And I thought, this is fair. This is this. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:52	<br><br>
	
A couple months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. I've always been with my band or my crew. Is this what stupid people do? (Laughter) Is this how stupid people die? And before I can change my mind, the door busts open. She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters, and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath, and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money, something that I did a lot. And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. And I recognized his fear of "Is this fair?" and "Get a job." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger. We signed with a major label. And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. It's not for everybody. Well, maybe it's for you. We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:33	<br><br>
	
And I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
They were like, "No, the sales are going down. It's a failure." And they walk off. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:40	<br><br>
	
Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, "I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend." (Laughter) "But I read your blog, I know you hate your label. I just want you to have this money." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:02	<br><br>
	
And this starts happening all the time. I become the hat after my own gigs, but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people, and unlike the guy in the opening band, I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:21	<br><br>
	
And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street. So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding, and I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me. And the goal was 100,000 dollars. My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:07	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:11	<br><br>
	
And you can see how many people it is. It's about 25,000 people. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
And the media asked, "Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music?" And the real answer is, I didn't make them. I asked them. And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you. It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:57	<br><br>
	
And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. And this hurt in a really familiar way. And people saying, "You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help," really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job." Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:49	<br><br>
	
So this is slightly not safe for work. This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me. Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers, I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people. This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much. Should I? Show me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community, connectors and openers, not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk. I see them as trust. Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there. But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly, but, more important, to ask without shame. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:32	<br><br>
	
My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box, so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:01	<br><br>
	
I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, "How do we make people pay for music?" What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:16	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:19	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:21	<br><br>
	
（吸气，呼气） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:28	<br><br>
	
我以前并不靠音乐谋生。 自从我五年前 从一所正派的文理学院毕业起 这是我白天的工作。 我是一座个体经营的、名为“8英尺新娘”的活雕像， 我喜欢告诉别人这是我的工作。 因为大家都想知道， 这些怪人在真实生活中到底是什么样的？ 大家好。 我每天把自己涂白，站在一个盒子上， 在脚边放一顶帽子或者一个罐子， 如果有路过的人向里面投钱 我递给他们一朵花，并且和他们进行强烈的眼神交流。 如果他们没有收下花， 我就表现出悲伤和充满渴望的样子 看着他们慢慢走远。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:26	<br><br>
	
我与人有着最深层次的接触， 尤其是那些看起来 好几个星期都没有与人交流的孤独者 我们共享一个美好的时刻 城市街道上可以发生的一次漫长眼神交流， 我们都感觉好像有点爱上对方。 我的眼睛会说，“谢谢。我看到你了。” 他们的眼睛则会说， “从来没有人在意我的存在。谢谢你。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:01	<br><br>
	
有时候我会被骚扰。 开车路过的人从车里对我大喊。 “找份工作去！” 我的反应是“这就是我的工作。” 但是这让我很伤心 因为这让我感觉我的工作不正经 不公平和可耻。 我没想到站在这个盒子上以音乐谋生的经历 竟会是有如此深刻的教育意义。 经济学家们你们可能会对这一点感兴趣， 我的收入其实相当稳定， 因为我没有固定的顾客 这一点让我自己也非常吃惊 我一般周二挣60美元，周五挣90美元。 我的收入是稳定的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:43	<br><br>
	
同时，我还在本地巡演 与我的乐队the Dresden Dolls一同在夜店演出。 这是我在弹钢琴，旁边是一位天才鼓手 我还搞歌曲创作， 我们的收入逐渐增加，最终，我不需要再做活人雕塑赚钱了， 我们开始巡演之后 我依然不想失去这种 与人直接交流的感觉，因为我喜欢这种感觉。 所以我们在表演结束之后一定会签名 拥抱我们的歌迷，和人交流互动， 我们将请求他人给予帮助或加入我们的过程 变成了一门艺术，我会找来当地的音乐家和艺术家 在我们的演出门口表演， 他们会传递一个帽子， 随后他们进入演出场馆和我们一起登上舞台 也就是说，我们有着不断更替的、各种各样的、随机的、古怪的表演嘉宾。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:31	<br><br>
	
后来，微博（Twitter）的出现 让事情变得更加神奇，因为 我可以在任意时间和地点提出任何要求。 我可能会需要一架钢琴练习， 一个小时之后，我就在歌迷的家里弹琴。这件事发生在伦敦。 在世界各地都有人 把自己做的食物送到我们的后台并和我们一起吃。这是在西雅图。 如果我临时决定搞一场即兴的演唱会， 在博物馆、商店或者任何其它公共场所工作的歌迷 就会向我们发出邀请。 这是奥克兰的一家图书馆。 周六我发微博希望有人为我提供木板箱和帽子， 因为我不想把它们从东海岸带到这里， 最终来自纽波特比奇（Newport Beach）的Chris 为我提供了这两样道具，他也向大家问好。 我曾经发微博问墨尔本哪里有卖洗鼻壶（neti pot）？ 一位在医院工作的护士开车 直接把它送到了我在的咖啡馆里， 我给她买了一杯沙冰 我们坐在一起聊护理和死亡。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:29	<br><br>
	
我喜欢这样幸运的、随机的亲近感觉 因为我常常做沙发客。 在大房子里，我们的每一位团队成员都有自己的房间， 但是没有无线网，在朋克乐迷占据的废弃房屋里， 所有人都睡在一间房间的地板上，没有卫生间 但是有无线网，这一优势第二种方式成为了更好的选择。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:49	<br><br>
	
（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:51	<br><br>
	
我的团队曾经把车 停在一个非常贫穷的迈阿密社区 我们发现当晚招待我们的是一个 依然与父母同住的18岁女孩， 他们一家人都是来自洪都拉斯的非法移民。 那天晚上，他们一家人 都睡沙发，她和她妈妈挤在一起 让我们睡他们的床。 我就躺在那里想， 这些人拥有的东西这么少。 这样公平吗？ 早晨，她妈妈教我们做 玉米薄饼（tortilla），还想给我一本《圣经》， 她把我叫到一边，用支离破碎的英语对我说， “你的音乐对我女儿的帮助很大。 谢谢你能住在这里。我们都很感激。“ 然后我想，这就公平了。 是这种过程。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:52	<br><br>
	
几个月之后，我在曼哈顿 发微博希望找一个过夜的地方，午夜时分 我在下东区（Lower East Side）按一户人家的门铃， 然后我突然意识到我从来没有一个人借宿过。 我以前一直和我的乐队或者团队在一起。 这是不是愚蠢的人做的事情？（笑声） 愚蠢的人是不是就是这样死的？ 我还没来得及改变主意，门就打开了。 她是一位艺术家。他是路透社的一位金融博客写手， 他们给我倒了一杯红酒 让我洗澡 我经历过成千上万个这样的夜晚。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:24	<br><br>
	
所以我常常做沙发客，也经常人群冲浪（从舞台上跳下，被观众接住）。 我认为做沙发客和人群冲浪 其实是一个概念。 落入人群中 和信任他人。 我曾经问一支为我们开场的乐队 他们愿不愿意到人群中去，传递帽子 筹一点额外的钱，我经常这样做。 和往常一样，乐队非常兴奋， 但是其中有一位成员告诉我 他没有办法说服自己这样做。 拿着帽子站在那里感觉实在是太像乞讨了。 我意识到这种恐惧就是我想到“这公平吗？”和听到“找份工作去！”的时候的感受。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
同时，我的乐队发展得越来越好。 我们和一家主流厂牌签约。 我们的音乐是朋克和卡巴莱(cabaret)的集合体。 不是所有人都能接受。 也许你会喜欢的。 签约之后，公司举办了大量的宣传活动为我们的新唱片造势。 唱片推出之后仅仅几周就卖出两万五千张， 但是我们的厂牌认为这是一张失败的专辑。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:33	<br><br>
	
我当时就说，“两万五千张，不是很多吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:35	<br><br>
	
他们说，“不，销量在下降。这是一张失败的唱片。” 随后他们就抛弃了我们。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:40	<br><br>
	
与此同时，一次演唱会结束之后，我为歌迷签名与他们拥抱的时候 一个人走上前来 给了我一张10美元的纸币， 他说： “不好意思，我从朋友那里翻录了你的CD。” （笑声） “不过我读了你的博客，我知道你不喜欢你的厂牌。 我希望你收下这笔钱。“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:02	<br><br>
	
这样的事情现在常常发生。 我们的演唱会结束之后，我变成了那个收集钱币的帽子， 我就站在那里，接受人们的帮助， 和之前开场乐队的那个成员不同 我在这方面拥有丰富的经验。 谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:21	<br><br>
	
那一刻我决定 我要抓住可能的机会 在网上免费共享我的音乐。 当时Metallica正在声讨（音乐分享网站）Napster 而我Amanda Palmer却在唱反调，鼓励 BT、下载、分享，但是我会请求人们的帮助 因为这种方式在街头是行得通的。 所以我和厂牌斗争，结束了合作， 并与我的乐队the Grand Theft Orchestra， 我开始在人群中融资。 我纵身一跃，跳入我建立的成千上万的联系之中 我请求人群接住我。 我的目标是十万美元 我的歌迷们为我提供了一百二十万， 这是历史上规模最大的音乐人群募资。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:07	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:11	<br><br>
	
可以看出有多少人参与了募款。 大约两万五千人。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
媒体会问，“Amanda， 音乐产业在衰亡，而你鼓励盗版。 你是如何让这么多人为音乐付钱的？“ 我真正的答案是，我并没有逼迫他们，我所作的是请求他们。 通过请求他人帮助 我与他们建立了联系 情感相通之后，人们就愿意帮助你。 对于很多艺术家来说，这似乎不合逻辑。 他们不愿意请求帮助。 不过这并不容易。开口提出请求是一件不容易的事情。 很多艺术家都不愿这样做。 请求帮助可能会让你很脆弱。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:57	<br><br>
	
Kickstarter（为创意项目募资的平台）上的项目发展壮大之后 我继续在人群中募资的行为 在网络上招来了很多批评。 尤其是邀请喜欢我们音乐的音乐人 上台与我们一同演唱几首歌曲 换取门票、啤酒，加深感情 这是某网站刊登的一张 处理过的我的照片。 这种受伤的感觉很熟悉。 人们说，”你现在已经没有资格 再这样请求帮助了，” 这让我想起那些在车里对我大喊“找份工作去。”的人们 他们没有和我们一起站在人行道上 他们没有见过 我和人们的交流， 一种我们认为公平，他们却从未体验过的交流。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:49	<br><br>
	
这是一项不宜在工作场所进行的工作。 这是在柏林举办的Kickstarter赞助者派对。 派对结束之前，我脱光了衣服让人们在我身上画画。 我用亲身经历告诉你们，如果你想体会 信任陌生人那种发自内心深处的感觉 我推荐这种方式， 尤其是这些陌生人都是醉酒的德国人的时候。 这是与歌迷交流的最高级别， 因为我真正传达的信息是， 我就是这样信任你们。 我应该这样做吗？用行动告诉我。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:24	<br><br>
	
在人类历史上的大部分时期， 音乐人、艺术家是社群的一部分 他们促进沟通，开拓新领域，不是无法触及的明星。 成为名人意味着有很多人从远方爱你， 然而因特网 和我们在网络上自由共享的内容 拉近了名人和支持者的距离。 现在则是一小部分人近距离的 为你提供足够的支持。 很多人不理解没有标准定价 这个概念。 他们认为这些事情不可预料的冒险，但是我所做的事情 Kickstarter，在街头募款，按陌生人的门铃 我不认为这些事情是风险。 我认为它们是信任。 现在，网络工具让这种交流 像在街头请求帮助一样简单和自然， 它们即将实现这种转变。 然而如果我们无法直面彼此 无所畏惧的给予和接受 完美的工具也无法帮助我们， 然而，更重要的是 不因请求帮助而感到羞愧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:32	<br><br>
	
做音乐的过程中，我一直希望 能像我站在盒子上的时候一样 与不同的人相遇 所以我的博客和微博上不仅有我们的巡演日期 我们的新音乐录音带，还有我们的作品、我们的艺术 我们的恐惧、宿醉和错误 这样我们就能真正感受到彼此的存在。 当我们真正建立这种联系时， 我们就希望互相帮助。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:01	<br><br>
	
我认为人们花了大量的精力试图解决错误的问题， 也就是“我们如何强迫人们付钱购买音乐？” 我们应该问一个新的问题， “我们如何让人们主动为音乐慷慨解囊？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:16	<br><br>
	
谢谢。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:19	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>

How can we measure what makes a school system work? Andreas Schleicher walks us through the PISA test, a global measurement that ranks countries against one another ― then uses that same data to help schools improve. Watch to find out where your country stacks up, and learn the single factor that makes some systems outperform others.	<br><br>
Andreas Schleicher	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education. We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:23	<br><br>
	
But I want to tell you the story of PISA, OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world, and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:41	<br><br>
	
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s, in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school. You can see the United States ahead of everyone else, and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education. But in the 1970s, some countries caught up. In the 1980s, the global expansion of the talent pool continued. And the world didn't stop in the 1990s. So in the '60s, the U.S. was first. In the '90s, it was 13th, and not because standards had fallen, but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:23	<br><br>
	
Korea shows you what's possible in education. Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today, and was one of the lowest education performers. Today, every young Korean finishes high school. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:42	<br><br>
	
So this tells us that, in a global economy, it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success, but the best performing education systems internationally. The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do. Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets, while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need. And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:24	<br><br>
	
So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly. And we took a very special angle to this. We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school, but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations. Now, some people have criticized us for this. They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before. But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
And once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard. In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy. This chart shows you the performance of countries. In red, sort of below OECD average. Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well. You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well. You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile, and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. Educators like to talk about equity. With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity, in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances. And we see that in some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong. Opportunities are unequally distributed. A lot of potential of young children is wasted. We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there, where performance is poor and there are large social disparities. And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities? Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity? But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson. And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. And ever since those results came out, policymakers, educators, researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:07	<br><br>
	
But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA, and I'm giving them a colored bubble now. And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes, you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no? But that's not what you see. Spending per student only explains about, well, less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries, and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well. What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results. You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
Let's look at this in greater detail. The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth. One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further. Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things. All that costs money. How can Korea afford all of this? The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes. This is the blue bar which is driving costs down. You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes. You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up. But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well. Students don't have long hours of learning. And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching. So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
Let's go back to the year 2000. Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented. This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance. The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no? We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education. So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better? And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries. But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities. And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees. Very disappointing results. People were stunned by the results. And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education, not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education was the center of the public debate. And then policymakers began to respond to this. The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education. A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage. And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten. PISA has transformed that debate, and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany. Or traditionally, the German education divides children at the age of 10, very young children, between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers, and that mainly along socioeconomic lines, and that paradigm is being challenged now too. A lot of change. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:59	<br><br>
	
And the good news is, nine years later, you can see improvements in quality and equity. People have taken up the challenge, done something about it. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:07	<br><br>
	
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum. In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence. They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:40	<br><br>
	
A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools, turn around many of the lowest-performing schools, and raise performance by over half a school year. And you can see other countries as well. Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary. 	<br><br>

So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change. And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible. You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture. It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes? And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere? Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale, but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share. Everybody agrees that education is important. Everybody says that. But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority against other priorities? How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers? Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer? How do the media talk about schools and teachers? Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today. And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school. Those things really exist. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:55	<br><br>
	
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture. The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success. You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards. But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities. If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed, and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent. If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else. Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort, and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:01	<br><br>
	
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways. High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices. They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents, and they personalize learning opportunities. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. Every student knows what matters. Every student knows what's required to be successful. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. High-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them. They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling, and how they structure teacher pay. They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice. And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. In bureaucratic school systems, teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching. High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is. They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today? The past was about delivered wisdom in education. Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom. High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization. They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy. They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices. The goal of the past was standardization and compliance. High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision. The high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system. You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools. Every school succeeds. This is where success is systemic. And how do they do that? They invest resources where they can make the most difference. They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools, and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:59	<br><br>
	
Last but not least, those countries align policies across all areas of public policy. They make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:12	<br><br>
	
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve. That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are. That's where other forms of research need to kick in, and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing. But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing. And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:44	<br><br>
	
You know, some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards. You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter) But PISA has shown what's possible in education. It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible. It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent. And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. If we can help every child, every teacher, every school, every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible, that only the sky is the limit to education improvement, we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:31	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>

学校教育的全方位开放 目前还是一件可望而不可及的事。 我们历尽艰辛才弄明白 学习不是一个在哪学的问题，而是一项活动。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:23	<br><br>
	
以下我要给大家介绍一下PISA（国际学生评估方案）， 这个方案是OECD（济合作与发展组织）用来测量世界上 15岁孩子们知识和技能的测试方案， 这一测试方案向我们展示了国与国之间的教育比较 是如何把原本是一国内政事务的教育领域 全球化的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:41	<br><br>
	
我们先从高中毕业生的比例这一标的 来看看20世纪60年代世界各国的教育 是什么样子的。 我们可以看到，美国遥遥领先排在首位， 而美国所取得的经济成就在很大程度上 得益于其长期 作为教育先行者的教育强国地位。 到了70年代，有些国家赶上来了， 到80年代，全球性的 人才扩展持续。 90年代，世界各国教育的发展并没停步。 所以，在60年代，美国教育排第一。 到90年代，其排名第13位， 其排名的下降，不是因为其本身的教育水准降低了， 而是因为别国的教育水平大大提高了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:23	<br><br>
	
韩国教育的（成功）经验向我们展示了教育的无限可能性。 两代人以前，韩国的生活水平 跟今天的阿富汗一样 其教育水平也是全球表现最差国之一。 而今天，韩国普及了高中教育。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:42	<br><br>
	
这告诉我们，在全球经济中， 衡量一国教育成功的基准不再只局限于本国的进步， 而是要将其放到国际上最好的教育系统中去进行比对才有意义。 可问题是 测量一个人在学校花的时间的多少 或者他们取得什么样的学位 并不能判断其实际工作能力。 目前的情况是，大街上到处都是失业的毕业生 而雇主却说他们招不到 他们所需要的专业技术人材。 这说明拥有好的学位并不等于会拥有相应的 好技能、好工作和美好生活。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:24	<br><br>
	
所以我们想运用PISA方法， 直接测量人们的知识和技能 以此来改变这种现象。 我们对此采取了一个非常特殊的视角。 我们对学生是否能简单地 复制他们在学校里学到的知识不很感兴趣， 我们想测试的是他们能否运用 他们已学的知识来进行推理 并将新知识运用到解决末知领域的问题中去。 可有人因此批评我们。 他们说，这种测量得出的结果 对人们是非常不公平的，因为我们用 学生们以前没见过的问题来测试他们。 但是，如果按这种逻辑 你会认为，人生十分的不公平， 对生活的真理的检验，不在于我们是否能记住了多少 我们在学校里学的东西， 而在于我们是否作好了随时应变的准备、 在于我们是否已经作好了从事那些 需要使用还没有发明的技术 去解决我们今天还没无预料的问题的新工作岗位的准备。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
经过激烈的争议， 我们测量的结果却很快成为公认的标准。 在2009的最新评估中， 我们测评了74个学校系统， 这些被测国的经济总量占全球经济总量的87%。 这个图展示了这些国家的（教育）表现。 红色表示稍低于OECD的平均值。 黄色代表一般般，绿色的国家做的很好。 你可以看到，亚洲的上海，南韩，新加坡； 欧洲的芬兰； 和北美的加拿大都做的很好。 从表中明显一个巨大的差距在于： 在受教育程度方面， 在15岁年龄阶层，上海的孩子比和智利孩子平均多受了3年半的教育, 如果算上其它教育更落后的国家， 这个差距将达到7个学年。 现在的年青人 对现代经济所做的准备也存在着巨大的差异。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:18	<br><br>
	
我想在这讲一下我们评估的 第二个重要依据。 教育家们喜欢讨论公平。 我们就用PISA来测试他们是如何做到教育公平， 也就是如何确保学生 无论其来自哪种不同的社会背景都有均等的受教育机会。 我们看到在有些国家， 学生的社会背景对其受教育机会的影响 非常巨大。 由于受教育机会的不均等。 很多小孩子的潜能没有得到开发而被埋没了。 在其他一些国家，学生的社会背景 对其受教育的机会没有太大的影响。 (在这张图中）)很多国家都想挤进右上象限里去， 因为一象限代表着这些国家的教育业绩很好，学习机会分配均等。 在教育落后地区， 没有任何个人和国家能进入优良教育象限， 这造成了社会教育的巨大不公平。 这样我们就能辩论， 我们是应该为了一国的教育成就 而牺牲学生受教育的公平机会？ 还是我们要注重教育的公平性而接受平庸呢？ 事实上，看一看这张图上出现的国家的教育成就， 可以看到很多国家实际上 做到了优秀和平等的统一。 事实上，从这个比较得到的最重要的教训之一 就是你不必为了达到优秀 而向平等妥协。 这些国家已经走出了由为部分人提供优质教育 到为所有人提供优质教育的发展之路， 这是个很重要的教训。 这也挑战了很多学校体系 一贯主张的"教育的功能就是要将人分为三六九等"的思维模式. 自从这些结果出现后， 来自世界各地的决策者，教育家，研究人员 都在试图搞清楚 这些教育系统成功的背后是什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:07	<br><br>
	
让我们先回顾一下 关注实际开始了PISA的这些国家， 我用彩色的泡泡来表示这些国家。 我用不同的大小 比例 来表示这些国家花在学生身上的钱。 如果教育投入的钱能够解释 学生学习的质量， 那照理在上面的那些国家的泡泡应该都很大才对，不是吗？ 但你看到的却不是。 生均教育经费投入 对一个国家教育质量的影响 大约不足20%， 例如，卢森堡是教育投入是最高的， 但其教育效果并不太好。 我们看到的是，两个经费投入相似的国家 可以取得完全不同的成就。 你也看到--我认为也是最鼓舞人的发现之一-- 我们居住的世界不是很一刀切地划分成 富有和教育程度高的国家， 与贫穷和教育程度很差的国家， 这是个很重要的教训。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:06	<br><br>
	
让我们看一些细节。 这个红点表示 生均教育经费投入与一国财富的关系。 一种投放方法是提高老师工资， 韩国在这方面投入大量资金 来吸引好的优秀的人才加入教育行列。 同时，韩国延长了学校时间， 此举进一步拉高教育投入。 最后，韩国要求他们的老师 不但要教好书，还要做好个人的职业发展。 他们在教师的职业发展与协作 和其它很多方面投入资金。 所有这些都得花钱。 韩国怎么付得起呢？ 答案是，韩国学校实行大班额教学。 从这根蓝棒可以看出，此举大大降低了办学费用。 看下一个国家，卢森堡 这个红点的位置和代表韩国的红点位置差不多， 所以，卢森堡和韩国的生均教育经费是一样的。 但你看，卢森堡的家长、老师甚至决策者们 都喜欢小班教学。 走进小课堂时很令人愉快。 所以他们把钱花在那里了， 从这根蓝棒可以看出，小班教学使办学经费大幅增加。 但就算是卢森堡这样的国家，其教育经费的投入也只能是一次性的， 而这种投入模式的代价是： 老师的收入不太好。 学生在校学习时间不长。 基本上，老师除了教学没时间做别的。 所以你看到两个国家花钱不同， 实际上他们如何花钱的影响 远远超过他们在教育上投入的金额。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:39	<br><br>
	
我们来看看2000年。 还记得吧？那是在iPod发明之前的一年。 如果用其PISA的表现来看， 当时各国的教育是这个样子的。 这些泡泡当时还很小，不是吗？ 我们在教育方面的投入也少得多， 只占不到35%。 扪心自问，既然教育都变得如此昂贵了， 它变得更好了吗？ 一个严酷的事实是， 并没有很多国家取得相应的成就。 但是有一些国家 已经取得了可喜的改善。 2000年我的祖国---德国 被划在较低的象限里， 比平均表现还低，社会差距很大。 别忘了，若只按拥有学位的人数来算， 德国曾是教育强国之一。 现在的结果却令人失望。 测评结果也令人吃惊。 几个月以来，教育而不是税务和其他的话题， 成了德国公开辩论的热门话题 这是史无前例的。 教育成了公共辩论的中心话题。 接着决策者开始有了回应。 联邦政府大幅度提高教育投入。 做了很多有利于 有移民或不良社会背景学生的事情。 更有意思的是，这不仅 优化了现有政策， 还改变了德国教育的 一些信仰和规范。 譬如，传统上，幼儿教育 被视作家庭的事，很多时候 当妇女把孩子送去幼儿园 被视为疏忽职守。 PISA改变了这场争论， 促使德国把儿童早期教育纳入了 公共政策的中心。 传统上，德国教育 在孩子10岁时，非常年幼的时候，就划分成 从事知识职业的工作者 和为知识工作者工作的两大群体， 这基本上与社会经济分工一致， 这个范例现在也在受挑战。 很多的改变。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:59	<br><br>
	
有个好消息是，九年后， 你会看到教学质量和公平性的改进。 人们已经接受了挑战并采取了一些措施。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:07	<br><br>
	
看这个范围的另一头韩国 在2000年，韩国已经很好了， 但韩国人担心 只有一小部分学生达到了很优秀的水平。 他们接受了挑战， 在十年间，韩国能将 阅读能力优秀学生的比例提高了一倍。 如果你只是专注于最出色的学生， 差距就会产生， 这个泡泡稍微往右偏移， 但还是有令人印象深刻的改进。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:40	<br><br>
	
波兰教育的主要革新 在于大幅度减少学校间的差异， 使很多表现不佳的学校得到重生， 并在半年时间内就提高了教学业绩。 其他一些国家也一样。 葡萄牙是能够巩固其分散的学校系统， 提高质量和改善公平性， 另外，匈牙利也做到了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:04	<br><br>
	
所以确实能看到，很多的改变。 即使那些抱怨的人说 那些相对有名次的国家 PISA只是文化的产物， 经济因素和社会的产物， 以及社会一致化的产物，等等， 这些人现在必须承认教育改良是可能。 波兰并没有改变它的文化。 没有改变它的经济， 没有改变人口的组成。 没有解雇老师。它改变了教育政策 和实践。（而其教育成就）却非常引人注目。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:39	<br><br>
	
所有这些给我们带来了新的命题： 我们能从这些在绿色象限的国家学到什么？ 谁做到了真正的公平? 谁取得了高水平的业绩和提高了成果？ 当然，问题是，在一个环境下有效的 在别的地方能用做典范吗？ 很显然，你不能把一国的教育体系生搬硬套到别国去， 但这些比较也确实帮我们找出了 所有高效能的教育系统的共性因素。 人人都同意教育很重要。 人人都这样说。 但问题是，你如何做到， “两害相权取其轻，两利相权取其重”呢？ 各国应如何支付他们的教师工资 和其他高级技术工人的工资呢？ 你想让你的孩子成为老师 而不是律师吗？ 媒体应该如何报道学校和老师呢？ 这些都是关键问题。而我们从PISA看到: 在高性能的教育体系里， 领袖们已经说服市民 重视教育，重视个人前途， 而不应该只着眼当前的消费。 在这过程中有一些很有趣的事。说出来令人难以相信， 在很多国家，最吸引人的地方 不是购物中心而是学校。 而事实确实如此。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:55	<br><br>
	
高度重视教育 只是其中的一方面。 另一方面，这是基于一种信念： 所有的孩子都有能力成功。 有些国家 学生们很年幼时就被实施分层教学。 学生们被分开， 这反映了他们的信念： 只有部分小子能达到世界一流的学业水准。 但通常是有很强的社会不公有关系。 如果你去亚洲的日本，或欧洲的芬兰， 这些国家的父母和老师们 期待每个学生都成功， 你会看到这些都会在学生的行为上表现出来。 当我们问学生 在数学上什么算是成功 北美的学生一般会告诉我们， 就是天分啦。 如果我生来就不是数学天才，我最好去学别的。 10个中有9个日本学生会说 这要看我的付出和努力， 这些都反映了他们所在的教育系统的理念。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:01	<br><br>
	
过去，不同的学生受教方法相似。 PISA中的业绩突出者 用有因材施教的方法来接纳多元性。 他们意识到 普通的学生也有杰出的天分， 他们把学习机会个性化。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:21	<br><br>
	
高性能系统也普遍认同 整个范围中的明确和有抱负的标准。 学生们都知道什么重要。 学生们都知道成功需要什么。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:33	<br><br>
	
没有一个地方教育系统的质量 超过老师的质量。 高性能的系统很小心地 招聘和选择老师 并培训他们。 他们留意如何帮助那些 在困境中挣扎的老师提高教学效率， 和如何去核定老师的工资。 他们提供一个老师们能团结工作的环境 去构架好的做法。 他们为老师提供各种途径 促进教师的职业成长。 在官僚的学校体系中， 老师常常被孤零零留在教室里照本宣科 因为教师们被很多的法规束缚着教与不教什么。 高效能的系统很清楚什么样的表现是好的。 他们设定雄心勃勃的标准， 但他们能让老师们去想办法弄清楚， 我今天需要给我的学生教什么。 过去教育是传递知识和智慧的桥梁。 而现在挑战在于让学生自己学习其所需的智慧。 高效率的执行者已经从职业或责任控制的管理者 转变成了专业的工作机构。 就好像，你如何检测 人们是否做了他们应该做的事 他们鼓励老师们在教学中勇于创新。 他们为老师提供其所需的发展机会 去制定更有力的教学方式。 以往的目标是标准化和服从。 高效率的体系让老师 和校长们富有独创性。 以前，政策专注于结果， 专注于条规。 高效率的体系帮助老师和 校长们放眼于他们人生中的下一个老师， 下一个学校。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
世界级系统的最令人印象深刻的结果是 他们在整个系统中实现了高性能。 你以看到芬兰在PISA中做的挺好， 但芬兰给人留下深刻印象的是 只有5%的学生的表现 在这些学校当中有变化。 每个学校都成功。 成功的是系统性。 怎么做到呢？ 他们给能产生最大不同的资源投资。 他们吸引最强的校长放到最难的学校， 最有才华的老师 放进最有挑战的教室。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:59	<br><br>
	
最后，这些国家调节 所有地区的公共政策 他们使之持续连贯， 确保始终如一地执行。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:12	<br><br>
	
知道了成功的系统怎么做的 并没有告诉我们如何改进。 也很清楚，这就是PISA国际比较 的一些极限。 也是其他形式的研究需要介入， 也是为什么PISA不冒险介入 告诉这些国家它们应该做什么。 但PISA的长处在于告诉他们 别人都做了些什么。 PISA的例子显示 数据比我们常用的通过运行教育系统 行政管理财务补贴更有威力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
18:44	<br><br>
	
有人会提出 改变教育行政管理 就像移动墓地。 你不能靠在外面的人来帮助。（笑） PISA已经显示了什么在教育上是可能的。 它帮助很多国家看到了改进是可行的。 它排除了那些自满者的借口。 它帮助一些国家设定了有意义的目标 也就是被世界领袖们达到了的可测量的目标。 如果我们能够帮助每个孩子，每个老师，每间学校， 每个校长，每个家长看到改进是可能的， 教育改进的空间是无限的， 我们已经打下了基础 为了更好的政策和更好的人生。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
19:31	<br><br>
	
谢谢大家！ 	<br><br>

James Glattfelder studies complexity: how an interconnected system ― say, a swarm of birds ― is more than the sum of its parts. And complexity theory, it turns out, can reveal a lot about how the economy works. Glattfelder shares a groundbreaking study of how control flows through the global economy, and how concentration of power in the hands of a shockingly small number leaves us all vulnerable.	<br><br>

When the crisis came, the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent. "There is also a strong belief, which I share, that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:34	<br><br>
	
Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism. But this is different. This is coming from the heart of finance. The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. The second quote is from the head of the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Are these people implying that we don't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies? It gets worse. "We spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society, a functioning economy, or peace." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:25	<br><br>
	
What's happening here? How can this be possible? Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:46	<br><br>
	
To explain what this means and what this thing is, please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. I ended up in physics by accident. It was a random encounter when I was young, and since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day. In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows. So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics. You encode it into equations. Then predictions can be made and tested. We're actually really lucky that this works, because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe. Despite the success, physics has its limits. As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote, we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us. This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems. So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts: swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets. These are just a few examples. Interestingly, complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations, so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
So what do we know about complex systems? Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions, so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. And it gets even better, because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. And all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system, how complex they are. So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird, you just focus on the rules of interaction. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
As a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems. The nodes in the network are the system's components and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics, complex networks are for the study of complex systems. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics, biology, computer science, the social sciences, but what about economics? Where are economic networks? This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature. The study we published last year called "The Network of Global Corporate Control" was the first extensive analysis of economic networks. The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media. This is quite remarkable, because, again, why did no one look at this before? Similar data has been around for quite some time. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:34	<br><br>
	
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks. So here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc. And the links represent the shareholding relations, so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B. And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations. In this little example, you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:14	<br><br>
	
Now you may think that no one's looked at this before because ownership networks are really, really boring to study. Well, as ownership is related to control, as I shall explain later, looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like, who are the key players? How are they organized? Are they isolated? Are they interconnected? And what is the overall distribution of control? In other words, who controls the world? I think this is an interesting question. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
And it has implications for systemic risk. This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall. A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability, because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data, because a foundational guideline in science is: Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
So we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007. This is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out who rules the world, we decided to focus on transnational corporations, or TNCs for short. These are companies that operate in more than one country, and we found 43,000. In the next step, we built the network around these companies, so we took all the TNCs' shareholders, and the shareholders' shareholders, etc., all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream, and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links. This is the TNC network which we analyzed. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:07	<br><br>
	
And it turns out to be structured as follows. So you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players, and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. To give you a better picture, think about a metropolitan area. So you have the suburbs and the periphery, you have a center like a financial district, then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center. And we already see signs of organization going on here. Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only, but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
Okay, so now we analyzed the structure, so how does this relate to the control? Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. This is the normal notion of control. And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership. If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company, you get control, but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares. And the network really matters. About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera had ownership and control in a small company, which had ownership and control in a bigger company. You get the idea. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26. So this means that, with each euro he invested, he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:57	<br><br>
	
Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder. This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power, which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:23	<br><br>
	
If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network, this is what you have to do. It's actually not that hard to understand. Let me explain by giving you this analogy. So think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness. So similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes. So what did we find after computing all this network control? Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value. Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes, so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent. They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K. And it gets even more extreme. There are 146 top players in the core, and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the TNCs' value. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
What should you take home from all of this? Well, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules. This means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization. It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:22	<br><br>
	
Our study "is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map." So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt, yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance." We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction, so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future. And this is slowly starting. We're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view. But this journey has only just begun, so we will have to wait before we see the first results. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:07	<br><br>
	
Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion. Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics, society, are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies. I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found. It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas, which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world. Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma. But this is just my own personal ideology. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:53	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:55	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
3:49	<br><br>
	
I unfortunately lost my train of thought, which results in the cut here. What I wanted to say:	<br><br>
 "This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions. You can then understand the complex system by simulating it in a computer. As an example, you need three simple rules to simulate swarming behavior: Move in the same direction as your neighbor, stay close to your neighbor, but avoid collisions. If you think this is no big deal, think again. No one saw this coming. And to this day no one really knows why this is the way things are. It's as if reality is giving us a big help in understanding how stuff works. Like the 'miracle' I mentioned before, those equations mirror the workings of the universe. And it gets even better, because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:11	<br><br>
	
I misspoke when I said, "Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only ... ." Instead, I meant to say, "Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the center only." 	<br><br>
	
	
0:11	<br><br>
	
“当危机来临时， 现有经济和金融模型的严重局限性 就立刻变得显而易见了。” ”我很坚信的一点，也是我想和大家分享的是： 不好的或是极其粗旷和自负的经济发展方式 促成了危机的来临。“ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:34	<br><br>
	
现在，你们很可能已经听到了 来自那些对资本主义持怀疑态度的人的相似的批评。 但其实这是不一样的。 这个问题产生于金融的核心。 第一句引述来自于 前欧洲央行行长特里谢。 第二句引述来自 英国金融服务局局长。 他们是否想暗示 我们并不了解那些促进我们现代社会的 经济体系呢？ 这变得很糟糕。 “我们花费大量的金钱 来试图了解宇宙的起源。 然而我们却仍然不明白 一个稳定的社会，良好的经济，或者和谐所需要的条件。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:25	<br><br>
	
到底发生了什么？这一切又是如何发生的？ 对于由人类交互而产生的现实世界， 我们对它的理解是否真的 比对它的建设更多呢？ 遗憾的是，答案是肯定的。 但是复杂性科学 提供了一个有趣的解决方案。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:46	<br><br>
	
为了说明这是什么及其所代表的含义， 请容许我简要回顾一下我的过去。 一个偶然的机会，我学习了物理。 这是我小时候的一个插曲， 并且从那以后，我便经常想知道 物理学在描述我们每天所处的现实世界方面 所获得的巨大成功。 简单来说，你能想到的物理是这样的： 你想要了解一系列的物理现象 然后你用数学对这一系列的物理现象进行建模。 你再把数学模型编译为数学方程。 最后我们可以对结果作出推断和测试。 我们的确很幸运对于这一切都能够行得通， 因为没有人真正知道我们的思想 为何与宇宙的基本规律有一定的联系。 尽管如此，物理学仍然有它的局限性。 就像Dirk Helbing在前一句引述中所指出的那样： 我们并不真正了解围绕在我们身边的 与我们息息相关的事物的复杂性。 这个悖论使我对复杂系统产生了兴趣。 这些系统包括了很多 连接和交互的部分： 比如说鸟群，鱼群，蚁群， 生态系统，人的大脑，金融市场。 这都是一些例子。 有趣的是，复杂系统通常很难 用数学方程来表示， 所以通常的物理方法在这里并不适用。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:20	<br><br>
	
那么关于复杂系统我们又知道些什么呢？ 事实是外部看起来 复杂的行为往往 （复杂性）是由一些简单的交互规则所形成的。 这表明你可以忘记数学方程 而通过观察交互关系 就可以开始理解系统。 所以你完全可以忘记数学方程 而仅仅从观察交互关系开始。 这会变得更好些，因为大部分的复杂系统 都具有一种神奇的特性――浮现。 这意味着 通过观察系统的组件 能够发现系统产生的 无法理解与预测的行为。 所以，系统整体并不是简单的局部之和。 这也表明你可以忽略系统的局部 以及系统局部的复杂性。 无论组成系统的是细胞，白蚁或是小鸟， 你仅仅需要关注系统交互的规则即可。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
因此，网络是复杂系统的 理想代表。 网络中的节点 是系统的组件， 并且网络中的联系是通过系统间的交互来体现的。 数学方程适用于物理， 而复杂网络则可用于复杂系统的研究。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:48	<br><br>
	
这种方法已经成功应用于 许多领域的复杂系统，例如，物理学，生物学， 计算机科学以及社会科学。 那对于经济学究竟如何呢？ 经济体系的网络又在哪里呢？ 在文献中，两者之间存在着巨大的差距。 我们去年发表的论文 “全球协作控制网络” 是第一个关于经济网络的广泛分析。 这项研究在因特网上迅速传播开来， 也吸引了来自国际媒体的广泛关注。 这是相当引人注目的。 但为什么以前没有人做这项研究呢？ 类似的数据已经存在了相当长的一段时间。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:34	<br><br>
	
我们仔细研究的是所有权网络。 所有权网络中的节点是公司，公民，政府 基金会等。 所有权网络中的联系代表了股权关系， 例如，股东A占有了公司B百分之x的股份。 我们也将公司的收益 通过赋值的方式标记在每一个节点上。 因此所有权网络揭示了 股权关系的模型。 在这个很小的例子中，你可以看到 一些具有特别联系的 金融机构。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:14	<br><br>
	
现在，也许你会认为过去没有人研究 所有权网络是因为 它实在太无趣乏味了。 然而，所有权与控制力是相关的， 这个我稍后会解释， 通过观察所有权网络你可以找到 以下一些问题的答案，例如， 谁是关键的角色？ 他们是如何组织的？他们是孤立的吗？ 他们是相互联系的吗？ 总体的控制力分布究竟是什么？ 换句话说，谁主宰着世界？ 我认为这是一个十分有趣的问题。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:47	<br><br>
	
这其中包含了系统危机的深层含义。 这也是系统总体脆弱性的一个评价标准。 系统高度的互联性 不利于系统的稳定， 因为压力能够像流行病一样 遍布系统。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:08	<br><br>
	
科学家们有时会批判 那些认为想法和概念 比经验数据更重要的经济学家， 这是因为科学的一条基本准则是： 用数据说话。好吧，那就这样吧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:23	<br><br>
	
我们从一个数据库开始，这个数据库包含了 从2007年开始的1300万条的所有权关系数据。 对于我们来说，数据量是极大的， 但为了能够发现谁掌控着世界, 我们决定将注意力集中在跨国公司上， 跨国公司可以简单地缩写为TNCs。 这些公司与不止一个国家有关系， 这样的公司有43000家。 接下来，我们组建关于跨国公司的网络， 我们考虑这些跨国公司的股东 以及股东的股东，等等。 先自底向上，再自顶向下， 最终形成了一个包含60万个节点 和100万条联系的网络。 这是我们分析的一个TNC网络。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:07	<br><br>
	
它最终是这样组织的： 网络由外围和中心两部分组成， 其中中心包含了75%的公司， 而且，中心还存在着微小却至关重要的核心， 这个核心是由联系高度紧密的公司所组成的。 为了能让你们更好地理解， 想象一个很大的城区。 这里有郊区， 也有城区的金融中心， 而TNC网络的核心就好比 城市金融中心的最高的那栋楼。 我们已经看见了呈现在眼前的组织标记。 36%的跨国公司仅仅存在于网络的核心区域， 但是它们却创造了 所有公司总营业收入的95%。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:57	<br><br>
	
现在让我们来分析一下结构， 它是怎样与控制力联系的呢？ 所有权赋予股东以投票权。 这是控制力的常规解释。 有不同的模式可以计算 所有权的控制力。 如果你占有一个公司超过50%的股份， 你就有控制力， 但是通常来说，控制力取决于占有股份的相对大小。 这个网络真的有助于我们的分析。 大约10年前，Provera先生 拥有一个小公司的所有权和控制力， 然而这个小公司却拥有对另一个大公司的所有权和控制力。 接下来，你们可以猜到了 这最终使他拥有了对意大利电信公司的控制力， 控制力的影响因子为26。 因此这表示，通过所有权关系链， 他每投资1欧元，就能通过所有权关系链 促使市值26欧元产生流通。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:57	<br><br>
	
现在，在我们的研究中所计算的 是对跨国公司控制力的值。 这就允许我们对每一个股东 影响力的进行赋值。 这很像是从 韦伯的潜力理论的角度来阐述的， 潜力表示的是一种能够无视他人的反对 而强加自己意愿的概率。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:23	<br><br>
	
假如你想计算所有权网络的流量， 当然这也是你必须要做的。 这实际上并不难理解。 让我通过类比来说明， 想象一下管道中流动的水， 同时，管道的厚度是不一样的。 类似地，控制力在所有权网络中流动 并在节点处累积。 那么在我们计算出网络的控制力之后，我们发现了什么？ 事实表明，737个顶尖的股东 拥有共同控制 80%公司的潜在能力。 请注意，我们开始的时候有60万个节点， 然而，这737个顶尖的股东 仅比所有股东的0.1%多一点点。 他们大多是来自美国和英国的金融机构。 更为极端的是， 有146个核心股东 他们共同拥有控制 40%公司的潜在能力。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:38	<br><br>
	
从中你能够得到什么启示呢？ 根据任何标准，控制力的集中程度 都是极其高的。 核心股东的 高度互联性 会使全球经济陷入重大的危机之中。 我们能够很容易地通过一些简单的规则 组建TNC网络。 这也意味着这个网络的结构是 系统自组织的成果。 这种新生的特性取决于 系统交互的规则， 所以这并不太可能是一种自顶向下方法的结果， 例如国际阴谋。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:22	<br><br>
	
我们的研究只是较为表面的东西， 没有触及太多的细节。 所以，你在分析我们研究中确切的数据时应该持有保留的态度， 因为它们并不总是十分精确。 然而这的确给了我们对崭新的金融世界的 华丽的诱人一瞥。 我们希望我们已经为更多的同类研究打开了一扇门， 剩下的未知都会在将来变得明朗。 虽然起步有点缓慢， 但我们能够预见将会有越来越多的 关于从复杂网络的角度来认识世界的 长期的，高额的资助项目出现。 然而这才刚刚开始， 因此在第一个成果产生以前，我们必须等待。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:07	<br><br>
	
如今在我看来仍然有一个大问题。 关于金融，经济，政治， 社会的想法很容易受到 人们主观意识的影响。 我真心希望复杂性的观点 能够帮助我们发现一些共性的基础。 冲突会造成阻塞， 如果它能够帮助我们清除阻碍世界发展的痼疾， 那就再好不过的了。 现实世界是纷繁复杂的，我们不应该墨守成规。 但这仅仅是我的个人理想。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:53	<br><br>
	
谢谢！ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:55	<br><br>
	
掌声。 	<br><br>

High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) ― and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations.	<br><br>

Transcript	<br><br>
0:15	<br><br>
Let me tell you a story. 	<br><br>
0:17	<br><br>
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher, and I'm so eager. I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans. But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. 	<br><br>
0:37	<br><br>
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack. And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?" 	<br><br>
1:00	<br><br>
There's silence. Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked." And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks." 	<br><br>
1:22	<br><br>
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now, and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat, that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook, but not one of them really understood the main ideas. Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool, why it's so important. 	<br><br>
1:47	<br><br>
I'm totally clueless. I have no idea what to do next. So the only thing I can think of is say, "Listen. Let me tell you a story. The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. These guys are blown up a couple million times. The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick." 	<br><br>
2:26	<br><br>
Now, the story that I start telling my kids, it starts out like a horror story. Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. Don't get too attached to him. Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good. Maybe he ate something bad for lunch, and then things get really horrible, as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus coming out from his insides. And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare. But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock." Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. Here's what had to happen. A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it. The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses. Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots. The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions. So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria. Some are much more crafty. When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium, they do a little espionage. Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first. Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions. And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them. So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells. They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out. It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium. So now you understand how viruses can attack cells. There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way, where the viruses go right in and take over the cells. On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. 	<br><br>
6:20	<br><br>
So this stuff is not that hard, right? And now all of you understand it. But if you've graduated from high school, I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before. But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind. 	<br><br>
6:37	<br><br>
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much? Well, there were a couple of reasons. 	<br><br>
6:44	<br><br>
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories. You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. It kills me. I'm not kidding. I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific." Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out. And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions! But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific. 	<br><br>
7:54	<br><br>
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible. If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium." The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium." That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds. 	<br><br>
8:30	<br><br>
But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students, because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate. For example, I told you that viruses have DNA. Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't. They have something called RNA instead. So a professional science writer would circle that and say, "That has to go. We have to change it to something much more technical." And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect. Then it would be accurate, but it would be completely impossible to understand. This is horrifying. 	<br><br>
9:26	<br><br>
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story. It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans. I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think ― " and you're just like, "Oh my God. What is the point?" Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually." Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness." And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles." And you're like, "Actually, shut up! I'm just trying to tell a story." 	<br><br>
10:32	<br><br>
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. 	<br><br>
11:09	<br><br>
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. That's not true at all. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds. If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science. But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this, that will ruin their chances of success. 	<br><br>
12:02	<br><br>
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it. But I think that's unlikely. So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up. There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways. I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand. And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances, and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp. The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats, but nonetheless it's so appreciative, so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science. 	<br><br>
13:26	<br><br>
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me. Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon. Make me laugh. Make me care. Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. How should you start? Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"? 	<br><br>
14:02	<br><br>
Thank you. 	<br><br>
14:04	<br><br>
(Applause) 	<br><br>
0:15	<br><br>
我来给大家讲个故事。 	<br><br>
0:17	<br><br>
我成为高中理科老师的第一年， 我非常的积极。 非常的兴奋，我全身心的投入到我的教学工作中。 但是我慢慢的认识到一个可怕的现实 我的学生可能什么都学不到。 	<br><br>
0:37	<br><br>
有一天， 我安排学生们阅读课本的一个章节， 这个章节讲的是我在生物学中最喜欢的主题―― 病毒以及其攻击原理。 我很兴奋能够跟他们讨论这个内容 我走进课堂，问：“有没有人能阐述一下本章主要内容， 并解释病毒为什么这么酷？ 	<br><br>
1:00	<br><br>
现场一片寂静。 终于，我最中意的学生，她看着我的眼睛， 说道，教材太恶心了 然后她澄清道：“我的意思是 我不是说内容恶心，我是说我根本看不懂。 太无聊了。嗯，管他呢，就是恶心。 	<br><br>
1:22	<br><br>
教室里一下子 充满了赞同的笑声。 我意识到班上所有的学生都是一样的感觉。 他们或许做了笔记，死记硬背了教材中的定义， 但没有一个人真正理解了其中意义。 没有一个人能告诉我为什么这东西有意思， 为什么它很重要。 	<br><br>
1:47	<br><br>
我完全迷茫了。 我不知道接下去要做什么。 我想到唯一可以做的是说， “听着，我来给大家讲个故事。 故事的主角是细菌和病毒。 现在我手上的这俩家伙是放大了几百万倍的样子， 真正的病毒和细菌太小了， 小到我们只能用显微镜才能看到。 你们可能对细菌和病毒并不陌生， 因为它们会让我们生病。 但很多人都不知道的是，病毒 也可以让细菌生病。” 	<br><br>
2:26	<br><br>
而后，我开始给学生们讲故事。 故事的开头有点恐怖。 很久很久以前，有一个快乐的小细菌。 别太投入了。 他可能正在你的胃里， 或是在一些变质的食物里游荡。 突然之间，他开始感觉不大对劲了。 可能他午饭吃坏肚子了， 然后事情变得非常的可怕 它的皮肤裂开了，它看到一个病毒 从他体内钻了出来。 更恐怖的事情是 它的身体爆炸了，成群的病毒 从细菌的体内喷涌了出来。 如果――哦，是的―― 如果你是一个细菌而你目睹了这一幕， 这将是你最可怕的噩梦。 但如果你是一只病毒，此情此景， 你可能就会悠闲地跷着二郎腿心想， “我们太牛了。” 因为病毒需要通过很巧妙的方式来感染细菌。 以下是具体过程： 一个病毒抓住一个细菌， 悄悄把自己的DNA注入细菌。 接下来，病毒的DNA生成了一些物质 破坏了细菌原有的DNA。 现在细菌的DNA已经被破坏了， 病毒的DNA控制了整个细胞。 然后病毒DNA开始复制更多的病毒。 因为，你看，DNA像是一个制造图纸 指示生命体制造指定的物质。 这就像原本是一个造车工厂 图纸被替换了，开始造杀人机器人了。 工人们第二天照旧来上班开工， 但他们执行的却是完全不同的指示。 那么，将细菌的DNA更换为病毒的DNA 就使得细菌自身成为了一间制造病毒的工厂， 直到生产的病毒多到把细菌撑爆了为止。 但这并非是病毒感染细菌的唯一途径。 有些方法更加精妙。 当一个病毒“特工”感染一个细菌， 间谍活动随之展开。 这名潜行的特工不动声色地将其DNA送入细菌细胞， 但秘诀在于：它不会伤害细菌――至少现在不会。 相反，它默默潜伏于细菌自身的DNA中， 犹如一枚定时炸弹， 静静地等待指令。 有趣的是，接下来当细菌开始繁殖，有了自己的孩子时， 它的孩子也带有病毒的这段DNA。 于是当细菌繁衍成为一个大家族， 每一个家族成员都带有病毒的定时炸弹。 他们幸福地生活在一起，直到信号出现。 于是，“砰！”地一声，所有的潜伏DNA被唤醒了。 病毒DNA控制了这些细胞，将其变为制造病毒的工厂， 并让它们全部涨裂。 于是，熙熙攘攘的细菌大家族， 就这样被病毒由内而外全部消灭。 病毒完全接管了细菌体。 于是现在大家能理解病毒是如何攻击细胞的了。 总共有两种途径：左边的我们称其为裂解性感染， 病毒一旦进入即掌控整个细胞。 右边的我们称其为溶源性感染， 就是病毒特工闪亮登场的情境。 	<br><br>
6:20	<br><br>
所以这些东西也不是那么难嘛，对吧？ 现在大家都能够理解。 只要你高中毕了业， 我敢保证几乎每个人都看到过以上的东西。 只是这些知识是以其他的形式呈现的， 并没有给你留下什么印象。 	<br><br>
6:37	<br><br>
那么当我的学生们初次学习这些东西的时候， 为什么他们会这么痛恨这些？ 当然，有若干原因： 	<br><br>
6:44	<br><br>
其一，我可以保证他们的课本 可没有什么“病毒特工”或是恐怖小故事。 在科学界的交流中 通常有着对内容严肃性的执念。 我被“严谨”二字折磨死了，真的。 我曾在一家教育出版社供职， 作为一名撰稿人，我被告知永远不要用故事体 逗趣笑话或引人眼球的语言风格， 因为如果我用了的话，我的作品就不会被视为是 “严肃的”和“科学的”。 对吧？就好像上帝禁止学科学的人 找乐子一样。 所以我们的科学领域中充满了黏液 颜色变化等。注意看这个。 然后，当然，我们有优秀科学家必备的 爆炸！ 但是如果教材太有意思了， 似乎就不科学了。 	<br><br>
7:54	<br><br>
另一个问题在于， 教材中使用的语言真的是无法理解。 如果我们要总结我们之前讲的故事， 我们可以这么说： ”病毒通过把自己的DNA送入细菌体内 来复制自己。” 但如果要是写在课本里的语言，就会变成这样： “噬菌体病毒之复制 以病毒核酸向细菌体 之引入而开始。” 这个很好，对13岁小孩来说很合适。 	<br><br>
8:30	<br><br>
但是问题来了。在科学教育领域的 很多人会在看了这段话之后，说他们 不能这么教育学生， 因为这段话中的措辞并不完全准确。 比如，我之前告诉大家病毒有DNA。 好吧，很小一部分病毒是没有DNA， 相对应地，他们体内有另一种称为RNA的物质。 于是所谓专业的科学作者估计会把这处圈出来，说， “这不行 得换成更严谨科学的表述。” 然后经过专业科学编辑团队 审阅了这段简单的解释之后 他们可能会发现我说的每句话都有毛病 而他们必须要改掉所有不严谨的地方 他们不得不改掉所有不是 百分百精确的事情 现在或许是精确了 但是已经完全无法让人理解了 这太吓人了 	<br><br>
9:26	<br><br>
我一直在说通过讲故事进行教学 的想法 但是现在的科学课程教学是基于我称之为 精确性至上的教学法 这套方法不讲故事。 感觉讲故事的人很可怕，会把科学课程变成 传授我们尽人皆知的细碎知识， 就像是“哦，一天我跟朋友吃饭， 她穿的牛仔裤不好看。 我是说，他们不是真的牛仔裤，而是窄腿裤 但是，我想他们某种意义上更像是紧身裤 但是我想――你会类似反应“天哪， 到底想说什么？” 或者更糟，科学教育变成了 一个总是说“实际上”的人。 不是么？想象一下，“哦，伙计， 我们要在午夜起床然后 在黑夜中开车走100公里。” 然后一个人说，“实际上，是87.3公里哦” 然后你说，“实际上，闭嘴！” “我只是想说一个故事。” 	<br><br>
10:32	<br><br>
好的故事需要关注的是情感的联系。 我们需要说服我们的听众 我们说的话很重要。 而重要的是知道 忽略掉无关紧要的细节 重点才会得到突出。 我记得建筑大师密斯・凡德罗（Mies van der Rohe）说过， 我解释一下，当他说有时候 你必须通过谎言来传达真相 我想这跟科学教育 有相通之处。 	<br><br>
11:09	<br><br>
现在，最后， 我时常感到失望 人们会认为我是在鼓吹 科学的弱智化. 根本不是这样的。 我现在是MIT的在读博士， 我完全理解细节的重要性 专家之间交流时细节尤其重要 但是在教13岁孩子的时候不是那么重要的 如果一个孩子觉得病毒都是有DNA的 不大可能因此毁掉了他们成为科学家的机会。 但是如果一个孩子无法理解科学课程中的知识 并由于这些枯燥的东西而讨厌这门课程 这真的可能会毁掉他们成功的机会。 	<br><br>
12:02	<br><br>
这需要改变。 我希望这些改变来自于高层的机构 让他们能够意识到问题的存在 我祈求他们，祈求他们别再这么教学了。 但是我觉得不太现实。 还好我们很幸运的拥有互联网这样的资源 我们可以撇开这些管理机构，自底向上的 进行改变。 网上相关的教程越来越多 他们都尝试用简单和直白的语言 来解释科学原理 我希望有一个维基百科一样的网站 解释你能想到的任何科学概念 用一种任何一个中学生都能够理解的语言和方式。 而我自己把我的闲暇时间都投入到了 制作这些YouTube在线课程的事情上。 我用中学舞蹈的古怪动作来类比 化学等价原理。 我用夏令营中男孩和女孩的故事来 解释燃料电池原理 我收到的反馈，经常包含拼写错误 经常包含各种聊天缩写 但是撇开这些 我很感激这些评论 让我知道我的方法是正确的 我们就应该这样传授科学知识 	<br><br>
13:26	<br><br>
虽然还有很多很多的工作要做 如果你也有参与科学工作 我请求你加入我的行动。 录段视频，写篇博客，怎么都行， 但是请抛开严谨性，抛开术语口号。 逗观众开心，吸引他们注意。 抛开这些没人关心的恼人的细节 直击重点。 如何开场？ 为什么不尝试说：“来，我给你讲个故事“ 	<br><br>
14:02	<br><br>
谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Hey science teachers ― make it fun</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) ― and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations. 	<br><br>

Let me tell you a story. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher, and I'm so eager. I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans. But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:37	<br><br>
	
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack. And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:00	<br><br>
	
There's silence. Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked." And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it. It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now, and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat, that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook, but not one of them really understood the main ideas. Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool, why it's so important. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:47	<br><br>
	
I'm totally clueless. I have no idea what to do next. So the only thing I can think of is say, "Listen. Let me tell you a story. The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. These guys are blown up a couple million times. The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:26	<br><br>
	
Now, the story that I start telling my kids, it starts out like a horror story. Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. Don't get too attached to him. Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good. Maybe he ate something bad for lunch, and then things get really horrible, as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus coming out from his insides. And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare. But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock." Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. Here's what had to happen. A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it. The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses. Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make. So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots. The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions. So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria. Some are much more crafty. When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium, they do a little espionage. Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first. Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions. And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them. So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells. They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out. It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium. So now you understand how viruses can attack cells. There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way, where the viruses go right in and take over the cells. On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:20	<br><br>
	
So this stuff is not that hard, right? And now all of you understand it. But if you've graduated from high school, I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before. But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:37	<br><br>
	
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much? Well, there were a couple of reasons. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:44	<br><br>
	
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories. You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness. It kills me. I'm not kidding. I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific." Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science. So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out. And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions! But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:54	<br><br>
	
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible. If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium." The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium." That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:30	<br><br>
	
But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students, because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate. For example, I told you that viruses have DNA. Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't. They have something called RNA instead. So a professional science writer would circle that and say, "That has to go. We have to change it to something much more technical." And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect. Then it would be accurate, but it would be completely impossible to understand. This is horrifying. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:26	<br><br>
	
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story. It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans. I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think ― " and you're just like, "Oh my God. What is the point?" Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually." Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness." And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles." And you're like, "Actually, shut up! I'm just trying to tell a story." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:32	<br><br>
	
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:09	<br><br>
	
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. That's not true at all. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds. If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science. But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this, that will ruin their chances of success. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:02	<br><br>
	
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it. But I think that's unlikely. So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up. There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways. I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand. And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances, and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp. The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats, but nonetheless it's so appreciative, so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:26	<br><br>
	
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me. Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon. Make me laugh. Make me care. Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point. How should you start? Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"? 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:02	<br><br>
	
Thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:04	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>
	
0:15	<br><br>
	
我来给大家讲个故事。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:17	<br><br>
	
我成为高中理科老师的第一年， 我非常的积极。 非常的兴奋，我全身心的投入到我的教学工作中。 但是我慢慢的认识到一个可怕的现实 我的学生可能什么都学不到。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:37	<br><br>
	
有一天， 我安排学生们阅读课本的一个章节， 这个章节讲的是我在生物学中最喜欢的主题―― 病毒以及其攻击原理。 我很兴奋能够跟他们讨论这个内容 我走进课堂，问：“有没有人能阐述一下本章主要内容， 并解释病毒为什么这么酷？ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:00	<br><br>
	
现场一片寂静。 终于，我最中意的学生，她看着我的眼睛， 说道，教材太恶心了 然后她澄清道：“我的意思是 我不是说内容恶心，我是说我根本看不懂。 太无聊了。嗯，管他呢，就是恶心。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:22	<br><br>
	
教室里一下子 充满了赞同的笑声。 我意识到班上所有的学生都是一样的感觉。 他们或许做了笔记，死记硬背了教材中的定义， 但没有一个人真正理解了其中意义。 没有一个人能告诉我为什么这东西有意思， 为什么它很重要。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:47	<br><br>
	
我完全迷茫了。 我不知道接下去要做什么。 我想到唯一可以做的是说， “听着，我来给大家讲个故事。 故事的主角是细菌和病毒。 现在我手上的这俩家伙是放大了几百万倍的样子， 真正的病毒和细菌太小了， 小到我们只能用显微镜才能看到。 你们可能对细菌和病毒并不陌生， 因为它们会让我们生病。 但很多人都不知道的是，病毒 也可以让细菌生病。” 	<br><br>

虽然还有很多很多的工作要做 如果你也有参与科学工作 我请求你加入我的行动。 录段视频，写篇博客，怎么都行， 但是请抛开严谨性，抛开术语口号。 逗观众开心，吸引他们注意。 抛开这些没人关心的恼人的细节 直击重点。 如何开场？ 为什么不尝试说：“来，我给你讲个故事“ 	<br><br>

谢谢。 	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
Coding isn’t just for computer whizzes, says Mitch Resnick of MIT Media Lab ― it’s for everyone. In a fun, demo-filled talk Resnick outlines the benefits of teaching kids to code, so they can do more than just “read” new technologies ― but also create them. 	<br><br>

It was a Saturday afternoon in May, and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day, and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom, so I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day? I thought, why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab? We developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations, and then share their creations with one another. So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
Before making my own Mother's Day card, I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. So over the last several years, kids around the world ages 8 and up, have shared their projects, and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects, whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. So in the search box I typed in "Mother's Day," and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website, many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself. So I started taking a look at them. (Music) I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day. And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. Another one was an interactive project where, when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day," it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan. (Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative about how she had Googled to find out when Mother's Day was happening. (Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening, she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:22	<br><br>
	
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects. In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project, I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter) And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. She wrote back to me and she said, "I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy, but actually I was even happier for another reason. I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards, you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies. What do I mean by fluent? I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. When you become fluent with language, it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend. And it's similar with new technologies. By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards, these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:40	<br><br>
	
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this, because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives." But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term. I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. When you really look at it, how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies? You often see them in situations like this, or like this, and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming. But that doesn't really make you fluent. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:25	<br><br>
	
So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies, but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies. It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:45	<br><br>
	
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies? And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs, or code. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. You know, in recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code, or Black Girls Code. It seems that everybody is getting into the act. You know, just at the beginning of this year, at the turn of the new year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012. A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. And that triggered a debate in the U.K. about whether all the children there should learn to code. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:53	<br><br>
	
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this, it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. When many people think of coding, they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing, and they think of coding looking like this. And in fact, if this is what coding is like, it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
But coding doesn't have to be like this. Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. In this case, you take a move block, snap it into a stack, and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story, in this case controlling the big fish. After you've created your program, you can click on "share," and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:56	<br><br>
	
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with Scratch. Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website, there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork, and, yes, interactive Mother's Day cards. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this, to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. And it doesn't just stay on the screen. You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. Here's an example from Hong Kong, where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor, so the light sensor detects the hole in the board, so as they move the physical saw, the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months, and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. Here's an example. It uses the webcam. And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world. But instead of just playing someone else's game, you get to create the games, and if you see someone else's game, you can just say "see inside," and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is, and then, if there's so much video motion, it will then tell the balloon to pop. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:03	<br><br>
	
The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch, you can also use the microphone. Here's an example of a project using the microphone. So I'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping) (Laughter) (Applause) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:53	<br><br>
	
As kids are creating projects like this, they're learning to code, but even more importantly, they're coding to learn. Because as they learn to code, it enables them to learn many other things, opens up many new opportunities for learning. Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code, you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work. But that's just where it starts. When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn many other things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:42	<br><br>
	
Let me show you an example. Here's another project, and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses. These are after-school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low-income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies. And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago, I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one, and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game, but also he wanted to do more. He wanted to keep score. So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish, but he wanted to keep score, so that each time the big fish eats the little fish, the score would go up and it would keep track, and he didn't know how to do that. So I showed him. In Scratch, you can create something called a variable. I'll call it score. And that creates some new blocks for you, and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score, so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score. So I showed this to the clubhouse member -- let's call him Victor -- and Victor, when he saw that this block would let him increment the score, he knew exactly what to do. He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish. So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish, he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one. And it's in fact working. And he saw this, and he was so excited, he reached his hand out to me, and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you." And what went through my mind was, how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables? (Laughter) It doesn't happen in most classrooms, but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables, they don't know why they're learning it. It's nothing that, really, they can make use of. When you learn ideas like this in Scratch, you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you, that you can understand the reason for learning variables, and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better. Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools, but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention. Now he had a reason for learning variables. So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn, you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:21	<br><br>
	
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this, they're learning important concepts like variables, but that's just the start. As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts, he was also learning about the process of design, how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project like you see here. So he was learning many different core principles of design, about how to experiment with new ideas, how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts, how to collaborate with other people on your projects, about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong, how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. They're relevant for all sorts of different activities. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:17	<br><br>
	
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist? It's probably not so likely, but regardless of what he does, he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned. Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer, that these ideas are useful for everybody. Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language. When you become fluent with reading and writing, it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. Very few people become professional writers. But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write. Again, the same thing with coding. Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers, but those skills of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively -- skills you develop when you code in Scratch -- are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
And it's not just about your work life. Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life. Let me end with just one more example. So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom, she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch. So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design, and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:11	<br><br>
	
So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code, all of the children of Estonia learn to code, even my mom has learned to code, don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code? If you're interested in giving it a try, I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. It's scratch.mit.edu, and give a try at coding. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:35	<br><br>
	
Thanks very much. (Applause) 	<br><br>

五月的某个周六下午, 我突然意识到 明天就是母亲节了， 而我目前还没有给我妈准备礼物， 因此我开始考虑 应当送她什么母亲节礼物呢？ 我想，为什么我不给她做一个 互动型的母亲节贺卡呢 恰好可以借助Scratch软件-这是我和 我的研究团队在麻省理工学院媒体实验室开发的软件。 我们的研发成果使得人们能够很容易制作 他们自己的互动故事、游戏和动画， 并将他们的杰作与他人分享。 因此我想，这正是个好机会使用Scratch软件来 为我母亲做一个互动贺卡。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:55	<br><br>
	
在制作母亲节贺卡之前， 我觉得应该先看看 Scratch网站。 在过去的几年中，全世界的孩子们 一般8岁以上，分享了他们的作品， 我想，我很好奇，这300万作品中， 是否有专为母亲节而制作的贺卡呢。 因此我在搜索框中输入 “母亲节”， 我惊讶而欣慰地发现搜索列表中 有几十个母亲节贺卡 呈现在Scratch网页上， 其中有很多就在此前24小时内完成的， 大概作者都是像我一样的拖延着。 然后我开始看这些贺卡。（音乐声） 我看见其中一个的主角是一只小猫 和她的妈妈，小猫祝妈妈节日快乐。 制作者还很体贴地给她妈妈 设计了重复播放的按钮。 另外一个互动卡中， 当你把鼠标挪到“母亲节快乐”的字母上时， 就会显示出一句母亲节祝福语。 （音乐声）这一个贺卡中，制作者讲述了 她用Google查出 母亲节时间的经过。 （打字声）然后当她得知母亲节的时间后， 就发出了一份特别的母亲节问候， 告诉母亲自己有多爱她。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:22	<br><br>
	
我很喜欢看这些作品 并且和这些作品互动。 事实上，比起我自己制作，我更喜欢看这些作品， 所以我最后把几个作品的链接发给了我母亲。（笑声） 事实上，她的反应就如我所希望的那样。 她给我回信说， “我很骄傲，我的儿子能做出这样的软件， 让孩子们能够为自己母亲制作母亲节贺卡。” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
我母亲很高兴，这也让我很高兴， 但事实上，还有另一个原因让我更高兴。 我很高兴，因为这些孩子将Scratch 按照我们所希望的方式来使用了。 当他们制作母亲节互动卡时， 你会发现，他们真的 能熟练运用新的技术。 什么是熟练呢？ 我是指他们能够开始表达自己 并且表达他们的思想。 当你能熟练运用语言时， 这意味着你能够写日记， 能够给别人讲笑话或是给朋友写信。 这就类似于新的技术。 通过书写，也就是制作这些母亲节互动卡， 这些孩子们展示出他们对于驾驭 新技术的纯熟。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:40	<br><br>
	
现在你可能不会为此觉得惊讶， 因为很多人都觉得 现在的年轻人能够用现代科技做任何事情。 我是指，我们都听说过年轻人被称作“数字原住民”。 但事实上，我有些怀疑这个词。 我不确定我们是否应该称呼年轻人为“数字原住民”。 仔细思考一下，年轻人们是如何 花大多数时间来使用新技术的呢？ 你总是看见他们这样， 或是这样， 毫无疑问，年轻人 很喜欢而且能够熟练地 浏览网页、聊天、发信息和玩游戏。 但是仅此并不能令你熟练。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:25	<br><br>
	
而今天的年轻人有很多经验和 和很高的熟练度来与新技术互动， 但少有人用新技术来制作东西 或用新技术来表达自己。 这就像他们能够用新技术阅读 但是确不会用它书写。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:45	<br><br>
	
我很关心，如何帮助年轻人熟练运用技术 使他们能够用新技术书写。 这意味着他们应当能够 自己进行计算机编码。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:59	<br><br>
	
所以，人们越来越多地意识到 学习编程的重要性。 你知道，最近几年， 出现了几百个新组织或网站 来教人们学习编程。 你看看网上，你会看见“编码学院”(Codecademy) 或“编码道场”(CoderDojo)这样的地方 和“会编码的女孩”(Girls Who Code) 或者“黑女孩编码”(Black Girls Code)这类网站。 好像每个人都行动起来了。 你知道，就在今年初， 在新旧年交际之时， 纽约市长迈克尔・布隆伯格 做了一个新年决定，即他将要 在2012年学习编码。 几个月后，爱沙尼亚决定 该国所有一年级生必须学习编码。 这在英国引起了一场有关 是否所有孩子都应该学习编码的讨论。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:53	<br><br>
	
现在，对你们中的一些人来说，听到这个， 会觉得让每个人都学习编码会很奇怪。 很多人想到编码时，会觉得 这是一个很小圈子的人 会做的事情， 他们会这么觉得。 而事实上，如果编码的确如此， 那么它应该是只有很小范围内 有着特殊数学技能和技术背景的人 才能做的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:22	<br><br>
	
但编码不一定如此。 我来给你展示一下在Scratch上编码是什么样的。 在Scratch上编码，你只需把方块拼到一起。 在这个作品里，你拖动一个“移动”方块， 放入一个堆里， 这些堆控制你作品中 不同角色的动作。 这个堆是控制大鱼的。 当你完成作品之后，可以点击“分享”， 你就可以跟他人分享成果了， 这样他们就可以使用你的作品 并对它进行加工了。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:56	<br><br>
	
当然，鱼的游戏并非是唯一 一个Scratch能做的东西。 Scratch网站上的几百万个作品中， 从动画故事 到校园科学作品 到动漫肥皂剧 到虚拟建设工具箱 到经典视频游戏改编 到政治民意调查 到三角学教程 再到互动性艺术作品，对 就像互动性母亲节贺卡。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
7:26	<br><br>
	
所以我觉得有很多方法 能够让人们表达自己， 能令他们产生想法并与他人分享。 而且这不仅仅停留于频幕。 你也可以用编码来与你周围的真实世界互动。 这是一个来自香港的例子， 一些孩子做了个游戏 然后做了物理设备接口 连了一个光敏元件，这样光敏元件 会探测到木板上的洞， 在他们拉动实体锯子时 光敏元件就探测到洞 并控制频幕上的虚拟锯子 并将树锯倒。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:04	<br><br>
	
我们还会继续看到一些其他方法 能够将实体世界和虚拟世界连接起来 连接到我们周围的世界。 这里有一个来自新版Scratch的例子 新版Scratch我们会在几个月后发布， 我们希望再次 将你们带到新的方向上去。 这儿有个例子 它使用了网络摄像头。 我移动手时，可以打破气球 或者移动虫子。 这有点像微软体感游戏， 你可以用动作来与频幕互动。 但在这儿并不是让你玩别人的游戏， 而是你可以自己做一个游戏， 如果你看见一个人的游戏， 你可以点击“看里面”， 你就可以看见里面用于控制游戏的块堆。 会有一个新的块，说明有多少个视频动作， 然后，当动作数到达一定数目时， 它会控制气球爆开。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:03	<br><br>
	
它使用摄像头 来向Scratch传送信息， 同样的你也可以用麦克风来做。 这里有一个使用麦克风的例子。 所以我会让你们用你们的声音 来控制这个游戏。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:19	<br><br>
	
（蟋蟀叫）（大叫）（咀嚼声） （笑声） （掌声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:53	<br><br>
	
当孩子们制做这类游戏时， 他们就在学习编码， 但更重要的是，他们也在通过编码来学习。 因为对编码的学习， 使他们也能同时学到很多其它东西， 并获得学习 知识的机会。 同样的，可以用阅读和写作来比喻一下。 当你学习阅读和写作时，就有更多 机会来学习很多 东西。 当你学习阅读时，你就可以通过阅读来学习。 这与编码是一样的。 你学习编码时，也就可以通过编码来学习。 你可以学到的事物，有些很明显。 你会学到计算机的运行方式。 但这才是个开始。 学习编码时，你会得到机会学到 更多东西。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:42	<br><br>
	
让我来举几个例子。 这里有另外一个作品， 我是在参加一个计算机俱乐部时 看见的。 这些是我们帮助建立的课后学习中心， 可以帮助低收入家庭的年轻人 学习使用技术来表达自己。 几年前，当我去一个俱乐部时， 我看见一个13岁的男生在使用Scratch软件 制作一个像这样的游戏， 他对这游戏很满意并且感到骄傲， 但他还想做更多。 他想计分。 这是一个大鱼吃小鱼的游戏， 但是他想计分，这样每次 大鱼吃掉小鱼时， 分数会上升，就能够记录游戏动向， 但是他不知道该怎么做。 于是我就做给他看。 在Scratch中，你可以制作变量。 我给它取名为分数。 这样会出现一些新的块， 并出现一个能够计分的计分板， 每次我点击“改变分数”时，分数就会增加。 我向这位俱乐部成员展示―― 我们叫他维克多吧――展示给维克多看， 当他看见这个块可以增加分数时， 他就知道该怎么办了。 他拖动这个块 放入游戏中 也就是大鱼吃小鱼游戏中。 这样，每次大鱼吃小鱼时， 他就增加分数，这样分数就增加1. 这样就成功了。 他看见后，十分兴奋， 他向我伸出手， 说：“谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你。” 那时我心想， 作为老师，因为教会学生变量而被感谢的 机会有多少？（笑声） 这在大多数课堂中都不常见， 但那是因为在大多数课堂中，当孩子们学习变量时， 他们不知道为什么要学这些。 真的，他们学的东西根本用不上。 当你在Scratch学到这样的思想时， 学习的方式是有意义而且激励人心的， 因为你会明白学习变量的意义， 我们发现这样孩子们会学得更深入 学的更好。 我确定维克多在学校学过变量， 但他并没有重视过。 现在他有了学习变量的理由。 所以当你通过编码学习时，为了学习而编码时， 你是在有意义地学习，而这正是学习的最佳方法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:21	<br><br>
	
所以像维克多这样的孩子制作这类作品时， 他们也在学习变量这样的重要的思想， 但这仅是开始。 当维克多为这个游戏制作脚本时， 他也在学习如何进行设计， 如何将一个小的想法 变成一个完整的能够运行的作品， 就像你看见的作品这样。 因此他能够学习各种这句的原则， 以及如何尝试新的想法， 如何将复杂的想法简化分解成几个部分， 如何与他人合作完成作品， 出错时如何发现并纠正错误， 如何坚持， 如何在失败时面对挫折。 这些都是重要的能力 而且不仅仅是编码所需的。 这些能力适用于所有的事情。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:17	<br><br>
	
说不定维克多长大后会成为 程序设计员或计算机科学家呢！ 当然也有可能不是， 但不管他做什么工作， 他都能够运用这些学到的设计技能。 不管他长大后成为市场营销经理 或是技工或是社区组织者， 这些思想对任何人来说都是由用的。 同样的，也可以用语言来比喻。 当你能够熟练地阅读和写作时， 并不是说你一定要 成为职业作家。 很少有人成为职业作家。 但学习阅读和写作却对每个人都有用。 同样，编码也如此。 大多数人长大后不会成为职业 计算机科学家或程序设计员， 但这些技能，如创造性思维， 系统地推理，合作―― 这些都是即在Scratch编码时学到的技能―― 是人们在做任何工作时都很有用的。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
15:18	<br><br>
	
而且它们也不仅仅适用于你的工作中。 编码可以使你 在个人生活中表达思想和感情。 让我再用一个作品来结束吧。 这个作品是 在我将母亲节贺卡发给我母亲后， 她决定学习Scratch。 因此她为我的生日做了一张Scratch 生日贺卡发给我。 尽管这个作品不可能得什么设计奖项， 而且你可以确定，我83岁的老母 并不是要成为职业程序设计员或计算机科学家。 但是制作这个作品使她 能够将自己与关心的人联系起来 并使她不断学习新的东西 继续她的创造力 并找到新的表达自己的方法。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:11	<br><br>
	
所以就像我们看见的 纽约市长迈克尔・布隆伯格在学习编码， 爱沙尼亚的所有孩子都在学习编码， 连我母亲都在学习编码， 难道你不觉得，你开始学习编码 只是个时间问题么？ 如果你有兴趣尝试， 我鼓励你去Scratch网站。 网址是scratch.mit.edu， 试试编码吧。 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:35	<br><br>
	
谢谢。（掌声） 	<br><br>

How can you help kids get a good start? In this heartfelt and personal talk, Colin Powell, the former U.S. Secretary of State, asks parents, friends and relatives to support children from before they even get to primary school, through community and a strong sense of responsibility. 	<br><br>

What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled. Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but ― (Laughter) ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:23	<br><br>
	
I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure. This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn, New York, at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits. And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them. They were around me in three directions. You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority. You'll notice that the building is rather austere. It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy. They still have old blackboards and whatnot. And there are about 300 kids in this school, and the school's been going now for four years, and they're about to graduate their first class. Twenty-two people are graduating, and all 22 are going to college. They all come from homes where there is, for the most part, just one person in the home, usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it, and they come here for their education and for their structure. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:18	<br><br>
	
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up on my Facebook page last week, and somebody wrote in, "Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?" And then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:34	<br><br>
	
He does look good, because kids need structure, and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids, I then invite them to ask questions, and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up," and I make them come up and stand in front of me. I make them stand at attention like a soldier. Put your arms straight down at your side, look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead, and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear. No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff. (Laughter) And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz -- he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral. (Laughter) So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. No, we're having a little fun. And the thing about it, I've done this for years, the younger they are, the more fun it is. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:24	<br><br>
	
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group, I have to figure out how to keep them quiet. You know that they'll always start yakking. And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:34	<br><br>
	
I say, "Now listen. In the army, when we want you to pay attention, we have a command. It's called 'at ease.' It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up. Do you understand?" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."Let's practice. Everybody start chatting. And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!" 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:55	<br><br>
	
Huh! (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
Yes, General. Yes, General. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
Try it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter) I don't think so. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:07	<br><br>
	
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously from my military experience. Because for the majority of my adult life, I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them. And we would bring them into the army, and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure, put them in ranks, make them all wear the same clothes, cut all their hair off so they look alike, make sure that they are standing in ranks. We teach them how to go right face, left face, so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions. It gives them structure. And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant. And they hate him. And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them, and telling them to do all kinds of awful things. But then the most amazing thing happens over time. Once that structure is developed, once they understand the reason for something, once they understand, "Mama ain't here, son. I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy. And that's just the way it is. You got that, son? Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers: yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir. Don't start telling me why you didn't do something. It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
You didn't shave."But sir ― 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:25	<br><br>
	
No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. I'm telling you you didn't shave. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
No excuse, sir."Attaboy, you're learning fast. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:33	<br><br>
	
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure. In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature. And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant. They come to respect him. And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
I spend a lot of time with youth groups, and I say to people, "When does the education process begin?" We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools. Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools. Let's get it all online." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:10	<br><br>
	
That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer. But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade? No, no, it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says, "Oh, this must be my mother. She's the one who feeds me. Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there, she takes care of me. It's her language I will learn." And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age, but by three months, that's her. And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother or grandmother, whoever's doing it, that is when the education process begins. That's when language begins. That's when love begins. That's when structure begins. That's when you start to imprint on the child that "you are special, you are different from every other child in the world. And we're going to read to you." A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school. A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes, doesn't know how to do those things, and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind. Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying! This is the way children are raised properly. And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're, much to the distress of my children, they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:49	<br><br>
	
And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school. And I'm working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool, we need Head Start, we need prenatal care. The education process begins even before the child is born, and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty. And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing, they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go, and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet. And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they're behind, and what do they do? They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts. It's predictable. If you're not at the right reading level at third grade, you are a candidate for jail at age 18, and we have the highest incarceration rate because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:01	<br><br>
	
The last chapter in my book is called "The Gift of a Good Start." The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:10	<br><br>
	
I was privileged to have that kind of good start. I was not a great student. I was a public school kid in New York City, and I didn't do well at all. I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college. I wanted it when I was writing my first book. I wanted to see if my memory was correct, and, my God, it was. (Laughter) Straight C everywhere. And I finally bounced through high school, got into the City College of New York with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with, and then I started out in engineering, and that only lasted six months. (Laughter) And then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy. And then I found ROTC. I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing, and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way. And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military. And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you, always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing, and when you find those two things together, man, you got it. That's what's going on. And that's what I found. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
9:21	<br><br>
	
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there. I'd been there four and a half going on five years, and my grades were not doing particularly well, and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration. And so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC. Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else." And so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens." And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter) Yep. (Laughter) (Applause) They said, "It's good enough for government work. Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again." So they shipped me off to the army, and lo and behold, many years later, I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter) So, I tell young people everywhere, it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life, and you are blessed to be living in a country that, no matter where you start, you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself, you believe in the society and the country, and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along. And that's the key to success. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
10:45	<br><br>
	
But it begins with the gift of a good start. If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids, if we don't invest at the earliest age, we're going to be running into difficulties. It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low-income areas, because they're not getting the gift of a good start. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:10	<br><br>
	
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family, a good family, but having a family that said to me, "Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924. We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day. We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out." If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out," they'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid." (Laughter) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:52	<br><br>
	
They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx, but they had more than just expectations for us. They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family." Sometimes I would get in trouble, and my parents were coming home, and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen, and I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look, take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again." It devastated me when my mother did that to me. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:26	<br><br>
	
And I also had this extended network. Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe, a family, a community. In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings. I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers, but there were these tenement buildings, and these women were always hanging out one of the windows, leaning on a pillow. They never left. (Laughter) I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets, and they were always there. They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter) They never did anything. But what they did was keep us in play. They kept us in play. And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general, and they never expected any generals in the family, as long as you got an education and then you got a job. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff. You get a job and get out of the house. We don't have time to waste for that. And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families, all families. And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people, and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren, it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure, if you reach back and help, if you mentor, if you invest in boys and girls clubs, if you work with your school system, make sure it's the best school system, and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem, not just downtown Montessori on the West Side. All of us have to have a commitment to do that. And we're not just investing in the kids. We're investing in our future. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
14:21	<br><br>
	
We're going to be a minority-majority country in one more generation. Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority. And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority. We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours, a country that is like no other, a country that amazes me every single day, a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other. That's how the system's supposed to work. It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations. We touch every nation. Every nation touches us. We are a nation of immigrants. That's why we need sound immigration policy. It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation, or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty. One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of New York and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world. But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler. Gotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter) And no matter where I am or what I'm doing, I've got to do that. I even did it when I was Secretary of State. I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria ― (Laughter) ― be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler. In those days, I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter) And I would order the hot dog from the guy, and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- "I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter) "It's okay, it's okay." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:14	<br><br>
	
But now I'm alone. I'm alone. I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing. But I gotta have my hot dog. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:22	<br><br>
	
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle. And the scene repeats itself so often. I'll go up and ask for my hot dog, and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing, he'll say, "I know you. I see you on television. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:39	<br><br>
	
You're, well, you're General Powell." 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:41	<br><br>
	
Yes, yes."Oh ...  	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:44	<br><br>
	
I hand him the money. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:45	<br><br>
	
No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid. America has paid me. I never forget where I came from. But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:57	<br><br>
	
I accept the generosity, continue up the street, and it washes over me, my God, it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:05	<br><br>
	
So we are still that magnificent country, but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world, and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:22	<br><br>
	
Thank you very much. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
(Applause) 	<br><br>

今天下午，我想做些 和预订计划稍微不同的事 若想了解外交政策 你们可以欣赏，我不知道，Rachel Maddow （美国自由派名嘴）或某人的节目 但－（笑声）－ 	<br><br>
	
	
	
0:23	<br><br>
	
我想谈论的是年轻人和结构 年轻人和结构 这是上周三下午 在纽约布鲁克林区一所学校 由耶稣会经营的Cristo Rey高中 当时我对这群学生演讲，并观察他们 他们以三个方向环绕着我 你们注意到他们几乎都是少数族群 你们注意到这栋建筑十分简陋 这是一栋老旧的纽约校舍，十分简朴 他们仍使用旧式黑板等设备 大约300名孩子在这所学校就读 这所学校已成立四年 首届学生即将毕业 毕业生共有二十二人 二十二人都会上大学 他们全都来自于－大多来自于 只有一位亲人的家庭 通常是母亲或祖母，仅此而已 他们来这里接受教育 及结构训练 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:18	<br><br>
	
我拍了这张相片 上星期贴上我的Facebook页面 有人留言说 “哼，他为何让他像这样立正？” 接着写道，“但他看起来不错”（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
1:34	<br><br>
	
他看起来确实不错，因为孩子需要结构 我每次造访学校，必定会玩个把戏 当我稍微向孩子们说教后 接着会邀请他们发问 当他们举起手时，我会说，“到台上来” 让他们在我面前站好 我让他们像士兵一样立正 双臂笔直地贴在身侧 抬头挺胸、睁大双眼、直视前方 大声说出问题，让每个人都能听见 不可弯腰驼背 不可衣衫不整地穿垮裤等 （笑声） 这位年轻人，名字是－他姓Cruz－ 他爱极了，在Facebook上 大肆宣扬，使这件事广为流传 （笑声） 所以人们认为我刁难这个孩子 并非如此，我们乐在其中 至于这样的事，我已行之多年 在年纪越小的孩子身上效果越有趣 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:24	<br><br>
	
当我面对一群六、七岁的孩子时 必须设法让他们安静下来 你们知道，他们总是聒噪不休 因此我先和他们玩个小游戏 才让他们立正站好 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:34	<br><br>
	
我说，“听着，在军队里” 当我们希望你集中注意力时 我们有个口令，叫做“稍息” 表示每个人都得安静并留意，专心聆听 “明白吗？” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:47	<br><br>
	
“嗯哼、嗯哼、嗯哼” “让我们做个练习，大家开始聊天” 我让他们吵大约十秒钟 然后大喊，“稍息！” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:55	<br><br>
	
“啊！”（笑声） 	<br><br>
	
	
	
2:59	<br><br>
	
“是，将军。是，将军” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:01	<br><br>
	
不妨在你们孩子身上试试，看看是否奏效 （笑声） 我想不太可能 	<br><br>
	
	
	
3:07	<br><br>
	
总之这是我玩的一个游戏，显然这来自于 我的军事生涯体验 因为我成年后大半时光 都和年轻人共事，我称他们为“持枪青年” 我们将他们带入军队 我们所做的第一件事，就是将他们 放入组织境里，将他们放入行伍中 让他们全都穿着相同服装 剃短头发，让他们看起来如出一辙 确保他们能列队站好 我们教他们如何向右转、向左转 让他们服从指示 了解不服从指示的后果 这让他们明白何谓组织结构 然后向他们介绍一位 他们立刻会痛恨的人，士官长 他们对他恨之入骨 士官长开始对他们大声呼喊 命令他们做各种难为的事 但随着时光流逝 最令人惊异的事逐渐发生 一旦发展出那种组织结构 一旦他们明白某件事的道理 一旦他们明白，“妈妈不在这里，孩子” “我是你们最糟的噩梦，我是你们的父母” “明白吗？ 事实就是如此，了解吗，孩子？” “当我问你们问题时，只有三个可能答案” “是，长官；不，长官；没有理由，长官” “别告诉我为何你们没做到某件事” “你只能回答：是，长官； 不，长官；没有理由，长官” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:24	<br><br>
	
“你没刮胡子” “但长官－” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:25	<br><br>
	
“不，别告诉我你今早老是刮伤脸皮” “我说的是你没刮胡子” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:30	<br><br>
	
“没有理由，长官” “好小子，算你识相” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:33	<br><br>
	
但你会惊讶于能让他们做到的事 一旦你将他们放入那个组织结构中后 十八周后，他们会拥有 一身本领，他们会变得成熟 知道吗？他们开始钦佩士官长 他们对士官长永难忘怀 他们开始尊敬他 因此我们需要将更多这种结构和尊敬 灌输到孩子的生活中 	<br><br>
	
	
	
4:57	<br><br>
	
我花了很多时间和年轻人相处 当我询问人们，“教育过程从何时开始？” 大家总是说，“让我们改善学校” “让我们为教师提供更多方案 让我们在学校装设更多计算机” “让我们将一切放上网络” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:10	<br><br>
	
那并非全部答案，仅是部分答案 但真正答案从孩子入学开始 将组织结构的概念灌输到孩子心灵中 	<br><br>
	
	
	
5:21	<br><br>
	
学习过程从何时开始？从一年级开始吗？ 不，不，它开始于 孩子第一次在母亲怀中 仰视母亲时 心想，“喔，这必定是我的母亲” “她是抚育我的人” “喔，是的，当我不舒服时” “她会照料我” “我将学习她的语言” 那时，他们会将所有 那个年纪能学习的其他语言 都拒之门外 在最初三个月中，只听得进她的语言 如果做这件事的人，无论是母亲 或祖母，无论做这件事的人是谁 那就是教育过程的开始 那就是语言的开始 那就是爱的开始，那就是结构的开始 那就是当你开始对孩子灌输 “你是特别的” “你和世上任何其他孩子都不同” “我们会念书给你听” 不曾听过他人念书的孩子 入学后将处于风险中 一位不知道自己肤色的孩子 或不知道如何看时间，不知道如何系鞋带 不知道如何做那些事 不知道如何遵守 自小就扎根于我脑海的字眼：注意 注意你的举止！ 注意身边的大人！注意你说的话！ 这就是正确教养孩子的方式 当我现在观察自己年幼孙辈的言行 他们令我的孩子苦恼万分 他们的反应就像当年的我们 知道吗？你们让他们深受影响 	<br><br>
	
	
	
6:49	<br><br>
	
你们必须做的事 就是让孩子为接受教育和上学做准备 现在，我竭尽所能地 宣扬这个讯息 我们需要学前教育，我们需要启蒙计划 我们需要胎教 教育过程甚至在孩子诞生之前已经开始 如果不这么做，将会面临困境 许多小区面临这些困境 许多学校中的孩子 成为一年级新生时，他们双眼发亮 他们背上小背包，准备上学 然后发现自己不像其他一年级生一样 熟知书中内容 他们已经听过，看得懂英文字母 到了三年级，那些一开始缺乏 那种结构和思维的孩子 开始意识到自己落后他人，他们怎么做？ 他们表现脱轨行为，然后踏上 通往监狱之路，或踏上辍学之路 这是意料之事 如果到了三年级时，你的阅读能力不及格 到了十八岁，就是入狱的候选者 我们拥有最高的入监率 因为我们没有 让孩子的生命拥有正确的开始 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:01	<br><br>
	
我的著作中最后一章，标题为 “以好的开始作礼物” 以好的开始作礼物 每个孩子的生命都应该拥有好的开始 	<br><br>
	
	
	
8:10	<br><br>
	
我有幸拥有这种好的开始 我并非一位杰出学生 我就读于纽约市一所公立学校 各方面表现都不佳 我从纽约市教育局取得一份 从幼儿园到大学的完整成绩单 于撰写第一本着作时申请 我想知道我的记忆是否正确 天哪，确实如此（笑声） 从头到尾都是C 我终于在高中时期翻身 进入纽约市立学院 以平均78.3分的成绩 我本来应该无法录取 我最初主修工程学 仅持续了六个月（笑声） 然后转攻地质学 “捡石头运动”，简单极了 然后我发现ROTC（大学储备军官训练团） 我发现某样我擅长且喜欢的事 我发现一群志同道合的年轻人 因此我将毕生奉献于ROTC和军方 我经常对年轻人说，随着年龄增长 随着这种结构在你身上成长茁壮 努力不懈地寻找你所擅长及喜爱的事 当你发现两者吻合时，老兄，你找到了 这就是我的经历，这就是我的领悟 	<br><br>

此时，纽约市立学院 越来越厌倦我的存在 我在那里读了四年半，将近五年 我的成绩不甚理想 我和校方不时有些摩擦 因此他们说，“但他在ROTC表现优异” “看，他在那方面 全都拿A，但其他方面都不行” 因此他们说： “好，我们不妨采用他的ROTC成绩” “并入大学平均成绩 （Overall GPA），看看情况如何” 他们这么做了，使我的GPA上升到2.0（笑声） 没错（笑声）（掌声） 他们说，“这个成绩足以进政府单位” “把他送入军队 我们再也不会见到他，我们再也不会见到他” 因此他们把我送入军队 瞧，多年后 我被认为是纽约市立学院 最杰出的校友之一（笑声） 因此，我经常对年轻人说 并非生命的起点 而是你如何挥洒生命 决定了生命的结果 你有幸生活在这个国家 无论从何处起步，都拥有机会 只要你相信自己 相信这个社会和国家 相信你可以自我提升 随时自我教育 那就是成功的关键 	<br><br>

但这始于好的开始这份礼物 如果我们不将这份礼物给予每一位孩子 如果我们不在最早阶段进行投资 我们将面临困境 这就是整体辍学率将近25 %的原因 将近50 %少数族群 生活在低收入地区 因为他们得不到好的开始这份礼物 	<br><br>
	
	
	
11:10	<br><br>
	
我拥有好的开始这份礼物 不仅是诞生于不错的家庭 好的家庭，还有会对我这么说的家人 “听着，我们乘着香蕉船来到这个国家” “在1920和1924年” “我们每天在成衣厂做牛做马” “我们这么做不是为了让你吸毒” “或惹是生非，更别动辍学的念头” 如果我胆敢对身为移民的父母说 “你们知道吗？我厌倦了学校，打算辍学” 他们会说，“我们打算 和你断绝关系，就当没生过这个孩子” （笑声） 	<br><br>

他们对所有表亲 甚至住在 南布朗克斯的远亲移民都有所期许 但他们对我们的期许不仅于此 他们将羞耻心 彷佛匕首般地刺进我们心坎 “别让家族蒙羞” 有时我会惹麻烦 我父母会连忙赶回家 我待在自己房间里，等待后续发展 我独自坐着，对自己说，“好” “拿起皮带狠狠打我一顿，但－” 天哪，别再说什么‘让家族蒙羞’了” 当母亲这么对我说时，总是令我大受打击 	<br><br>
	
	
	
12:26	<br><br>
	
我也拥有一个广大的网络 孩子需要一个网络，孩子需要成为族群 家庭和小区的一份子 以我的情况来说 就是住在所有廉价公寓中的阿姨 我不知道在座有多少是纽约人 但纽约市有些廉价公寓 这些女人总是望着窗外 倚着枕头 她们从不离开（笑声） 老天保佑，我在这些街道上长大 她们总是存在 她们从不上厕所、从不煮饭（笑声） 她们什么也不干 但她们所做的就是让我们守法守分 她们不断地让我们守法守分 她们不在乎 你是否成为医生、律师或将军 她们不曾期望家族中出个将军 只要你接受教育，然后找一份工作 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:18	<br><br>
	
“别跟我们谈什么自我实现的理想” “只要找份工作，搬出家门” “我们没时间浪费在那种事上” “之后你就可以支持我们 这就是你们这些孩子的责任” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
13:29	<br><br>
	
因此，这是相当重要的一点 我们应该将这种文化 导回我们的家庭，所有家庭 这十分重要，在座各位 都是成功人士 我相信你们都拥有美好的家庭和子孙 这并不足够，你们必须伸出援手 帮助像Cruz先生这样的孩子 他们可以有所成就，如果你们给予他们结构 如果你们伸出援手，如果你们提供指导 如果你们资助男女童军 如果你们和学校系统携手合作 确保它成为最佳的学校系统 不仅是你们孩子的学校 还有那些位于哈林区的学校 不仅是位于西区市中心的蒙特梭利学校 我们每个人都该致力于这方面的贡献 我们投资的不仅是孩子 我们投资的是我们的未来 	<br><br>

再过一个世代 我们将成为以少数族群为主的国家 现在我们称为 少数族群的人，将会变成多数人口 我们必须确保他们 为成为多数人口做好准备 我们必须确保他们准备好 成为这个伟大国家的领袖 一个与众不同的国家 一个每天都带给我惊喜的国家 一个充满纷争的国家，我们总是争论不休 这就是这个系统的运作方式 这是一个 充满对立的国家，但它是国中之国 我们和每个国家息息相关 每个国家也和我们息息相关 我们是移民国家 这就是为什么我们需要健全的移民政策 这是十分荒谬的事－ 没有健全的移民政策 欢迎那些想来这里 成为这个伟大国家一份子的人 或者我们可以给予他们教育机会 帮助他们的人民脱离贫困 其中一个让我津津乐道的精采故事是 我喜欢返回纽约故居 在晴朗的日子沿着公园大道散步 欣赏周遭一切，观察与我擦肩而过 来自世界各地的人 但我必定会做的事 就是在其中一个转角停下 在移民手推车摊贩买热狗 非得吃个脏兮兮的热狗不可（笑声） 无论我身处何方或正在做什么 都非得做这件事不可 即使担任国务卿时也不例外 我会走出Waldorf Astoria酒店套房 （笑声） 沿着街道前进，然后在第55街转角 寻找移民手推车摊贩 当年我身边跟着五个保镳 三辆纽约市警车沿途护送 确保我沿着公园大道前进时不会遭到攻击 （笑声） 我会向小贩买个热狗 他会开始制作，然后环顾四周 看见那些保镳和警车 “我有绿卡！我有绿卡！”（笑声） “没事、没事” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:14	<br><br>
	
但现在我独自一人，独自一人 没有保镳，没有警车，什么也没有 但还是得吃热狗 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:22	<br><br>
	
我上星期才买过，那是某个星期二傍晚 就在哥伦布圆环附近 这是司空见惯的场景 我上前买热狗 那个小贩开始制作，即将完成时 他说，“我认得你，我在电视上见过你” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:39	<br><br>
	
“你是…嗯…你是鲍威尔将军” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:41	<br><br>
	
“是、是” “喔…” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:44	<br><br>
	
我把钱递给他 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:45	<br><br>
	
“不，将军 你不能付我钱，我已得到报偿” “美国已经给了我报偿 我永远不会忘记自己来自何方” “但我现在是美国人，长官，谢谢” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
16:57	<br><br>
	
我接受他的好意，继续沿着街道前进 脑海里浮现一个念头，天哪 这就是九十年前 以同样方式欢迎我父母的国家 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:05	<br><br>
	
因此，这依然是当年那个泱泱大国 但来自世界各地的年轻人 为这个国家贡献心力 我们的义务是 成为对这个美好国家有所贡献的公民 确保没有任何孩子会被遗忘 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:22	<br><br>
	
十分感谢 	<br><br>
	
	
	
17:24	<br><br>
	
（掌声） 	<br><br>
